##History 101:
To fully grasp all of the lessions that are hear in this book I need to start from the begining. Additionally you need to understand that Camp didn't just magically spring up, nor was it drempt up by some corporate big wigs then handed off to a team of well paid execs to start building. No, it all started with just 2 founders from simple backgrounds and moderate means.

Ups and downs - Bankrupsy

A beautiful partnership between 2 men:
* Steve Jobs - The businessesman
* Steve Woziniac - The Technician

####Getting Started:
Started with people they knew

Pure Luck: The Barn Floor

####Multiple Locations:

####Where are we now?








##History:
###1970 --(Note From Mr. W)Mr. W  begins building Camp with investment from a member of his church

###1971 --(Note From Mr. W)Mr. W Runs his first summer in camp

###1975 --(Note From Mr. W)They try to expand and started running into financial difficulty

----(The numbers are fuzzy in my memory)'Our monthly morgage payment was $1200 and I had no idea where we were going to get the money from. Next thing I knew our monthly morgage payment was $36,000 and I knew where the money was going to come from'
###1977 Bought in 
---Mr. J's farther who did maintaince at camp decideds to throw in and buy into Camp when the camp when to auction after its financial issues.
---Mr. J's father requests Mr. J leave his internship at the hotel and come home but Mr. J wanted to finish the degree. Because of this Mr. J missed the first sumer after the purchase.
---During this period the kitchen at the hotel Mr. J was working at was became the training facility and the original staff(mainly african american) was replaced with a mainly white but much less expirenced staff.
---Mr. J was permoted quickly at the hotel and eventually declined to manage his own hotel instead to return back to Camp to help his father run it.

--Over the next 5 years Mr. J worked his way into every system of Camp. The last of which was gymnastics staffing.  "Gymnastics staffing was the last thing I got my **grubby mits** into".

###1982 - US Boycots Olympics
--Gymnastics runs on a 4 year cycle. The year imediatly following the olympics have high enrollment rates.
--Each year after enrollment continues to drop.
--The boycot would mean an 8 year drop with no floor. This was bad for business.

--Mr. J connected with the American Bicycle association(not sure on the name) and was able to get this 'new thing call BMX'.
---BMX was gaining in popularity with pro bike racers that had their parents breathing down their neck to win and wanted to just be able to ride free.
--The gymnastics side was not happy

--Mr. J brought Loose Foam to BMX + Skate Boarding
--Insurance -- Bringing skate off of the street
----BMX Was Insured by Lords of London - Another agency(i forgot the name) wanted to insure skateboarding, they wanted Camp to bring skateboarding off the streets and make it safer. Mr. J confirmed the skateboarding insurance hung up the phone, then imediatly called them back and asked if they wanted to take BMX as well. The new agency agreed.
-----"Banks you have(or are trying to get) a morgage with like for you to have good insurance"
--Austrailian Ski team - 'Going to Camp is cheating' got published... everyone else wanted to 'cheat' so they came to Camp 

###1985 - Lake Owen

---Around this time (peacing this together from an earlier conversation) Mr. J was given the opportunity to purchase a handfull of restraunts, bars, and liquer stores. He declined to purchase Lake Owen(I think). The decision was made over one night. 

###1987 - 'The first skate board rolled onto Camp property'
---- Was going to build a softball field. They started by clearing the lot but Mr. J decided to build Lot 8
-----Lot 8 got its name because "there are going to be a lot of things rolling through here with 8 wheels" - I assume he meant roller blades.


###1998 - First time Mr. J was not on camp for even a single day during the on season
--Was flown out for an ESPN event(I think)
