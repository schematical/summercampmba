##New Intro:

As I begin to write this opening paragraph I am staring out over a mountain range that surrounds {X} square miles of camp where, for this week, around one thousand children and staff are calling home. {25} cabins each containing up to {40} campers are slowly waking up, brushing their teeth(I hope) and strolling down to breakfast. They will eventually make their way to the morning session of their chosen programs. 

Behind me Junior Staff are starting to open one of the three gyms where hundreds of gymnasts, tumblers, cheerleaders, snowboarders, and parkour athletes will be working out today.

In front of me I can see half a dozen skate parks and bike tracks that will be ridden by skateboarders, scooter kids, BMXers and mountain bikers.

{Tens of thousands} of dollars worth of frozen pizza, ice cream, frappuccinos, slushies, cookies, and other various snack foods will be sold today. 

Social media will be flooded with {thousands} of photos of smiling campers chasing their dreams of being a high level gymnast or landing that big skate trick off of the mini-mega ramp(For those of you not familiar a giant ramp similar to the ones in the x-games). This in turn will drive traffic to Campâ€™s website and boost enrollment in the upcoming weeks.

And this is all just today. Imagine an entire week of this? Imagine an entire 12 weeks of this. Imagine the other various locations of this camp with several thousand more campers each week. 

Now imagine what it takes to run this place at this location alone:

* Feeding 3 square meals a day to just under a thousand staff and campers with big appetites because they just spent the previous day working out or instructing. 
* Housing all those people each week.
* Transporting staff and campers to and from camp from all over the country/world.
* Dealing with all of the waste roughly one thousand individuals create, both garbage as well as keeping the toilets flushing smoothly.
* Keeping one thousand people healthy. Both from injuries such a bumps and bruises incurred while training as well as from the sore tummies and asthma attacks.
* Staffing all of this, and dealing with constant turn over; training new staff each week to operate this place.

Imagine what it takes to do all of this and more. 


Forty some years ago the founders of this place bought a small farm in the middle of nowhere mountain country and started off with just a dream. Since then they have managed to grow this place into one of the world's most popular summer camps and sprout up international franchise locations all over the world. This amazing, beautiful, complex, machine is a living breathing masterpiece. It is truly amazing what a hand full of people lead by two brilliant visionaries built in the middle of nowhere; In a valley surrounded by farms, {10} miles from the nearest traffic light.

This place is a great many things to a great many people. To some campers it is skateboard heaven. Parkour athletes may see it as the holy land of parkour. A lot of the gymnasts see it as their favorite week of the year. To some of the younger staff it is a great way to train and earn a hundred or so dollars a week(A hell of a lot better than flipping burgers). Other more serious career coaches see it as a way to learn from other more established coaches. To pretty much everyone, staff and camper, it is an amazing life changing experience.

To me it is all that and more. Though I love all of the simple enjoyments here:

* Playing "Mat Tag" for warmup.
* Enjoying a free ice cream while watching some kids butcher a song during Karaoke
* Having a smore around a bon fire
* A ride on the go-karts
* Enjoying the company of my many friends that I have made from many various backgrounds
* Hob nobbing with any one of the many olympic gold medalists that that attend camp
* The excitement in the eyes of an athlete after I help them achieve a big skill
* Sneaking in a hand balancing workout in between coaching sessions

But as serial entrepreneur I can appreciate this amazing place for the side that most of the campers are completely unaware of. Camp is also a business. The reality is in order to create all of those experiences, serve all of those meals, maintain all of those skate ramps and trampolines we need staff, materials, and facilities that all cost money. To make the money to do all of these things Camp has to be a business. It must have employees, do marketing, provide a service, and in the end turn a profit. 


Chances are the fact that Camp is an amazingly well designed and run business is exactly why you picked this book up. So you too can learn from the 40 plus years of lessons learned the hard way by the founders and people that run. Lessions I have attempted to put into writing for your benifit here in this book.



###Who am I?
I am just a guy that has had the privilege and honor of being able to observe, learn from and implement many of the brilliant lessons this amazing place has to offer. Many business lessons, but also life lessons that have made my life all the better. In case you're curious how I have been so fortunate as to land in a position where I could soak up so much knowledge I will share a bit of my story with you.

In 2004 I was a wide eyed 19 year old who had just returned home to Wisconsin from a catastrophic summer semester of college in Arizona. I had started assistant coaching at the local YMCA again which had been my passion since I started coaching at the age of 17. The athletes in my charge were going to go to a sibling branch of Camp in my home state of Wisconsin where I was invited to be a "Visiting Coach" for the week. 

I had never been a competitive gymnast and had never been to any branches of Camp. When I got there I immediately fell in love with it. The next few summers I spent every week I could at the Wisconsin branch of camp. Eventually around the age of 22 I fell victim to the fallacy that I needed to get a _"real job"_ and stopped going to camp all summer each summer. 


Luckily the _"real job"_ phase didn't last long for me. I proceeded to start and crash a series of small tech businesses each time falling back to coaching gymnastics as my rock; each time growing tougher and more experienced. A few years after I stopped going the Wisconsin camp location was sold to a large private investor.


The summer of 2013 one of the directors at the original, non-wisconsin, camp location convinced me and one of my high level athletes to come out for two weeks at the beginning of summer. We did our two weeks and I immediately fell in love with camp all over again. The two weeks flew by and we headed home. I had been working a tech contract for a startup in Milwaukee for the past 9 months and was about to show up for work the Monday after I got back when I got a phone call explaining that the startup had fallen on hard financial times(go figure) and had to lay off all of the contractors. 

So there I was with no job, no severance, no 2 week's notice or anything.  Having been in far worse financial situations before I didn't panic. Instead having recently re-fallen in love with the camp life calmly called up the head gym director(who I will talk more about later) and asked if they needed staff for the rest of the summer. Luckily they said they would take me so I jumped on the bus camp charters to and from Chicago to camp each week. Between then and now I have called camp my summer home and hope to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.


Throughout the normal year and even when I am at camp I continue to run my businesses. The most successful of my businesses currently being my tech consulting business but I am also expanding into real estate investments and publishing a few books(one which you are reading now). 

###What you can learn from this book:
I find it fascinating how the lessons I have learned at Camp can be applied to such a wide variety of business, even in industries so different as my tech consulting business. In this book I go over many of the lessons I have learned and applied to my own business. Lesions such as:

* How camp sells a particular clothing item at  {25} times markup from the wholesale cost of the product. 
* How they actually have campers paying to come and produce promotional content for camp. 
* How they manage to cut costs and scale down to just a handful of people in the off-season.
* How camp manages to run with an astounding {25-50%} staff turn over every week. 
* How to manage an ever changing staff of inexperienced and experienced, many of which have huge egos

And many more lessons which I hope you can apply to your own life and business.


##Conclusion:
//This is probablly the place to get on your pedistal and talk about education... possibly.
//Really drive in the term Summer Camp MBA


##Why I don't use Camp's real name://MIGHT MOVE THIS TO HISTORY...
You probably realized that Camp is not just called "Camp" it has a real name and a hell of a brand behind it. So you're probably wondering "Why I am not using that name?". The answer is because I have not yet asked those who run Camp's permission yet. One of the many lessons I have learned is to _ask forgiveness, not permission_. My plan is to write this early draft of Summer Camp MBA and show it to some key people. If the powers that be want to allow me to use their name great. If not I am perfectly fine publishing this book simply calling this amazing place just "Camp".
