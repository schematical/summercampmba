# Hiring/Training Staff 101:
One of the most difficult things I have ever done in my business is hiring and training staff. Admitedly I am not as good at is as I would like. That is why I have spent hours and hours studying over how camp has been able to be so successfull with it. 

## The Numbers:
Let me explain to you how vast and complex the staffing situation is at camp. At the original east coast location of camp our max capacity for campers is somewhere in the mid 700s children per week, we can put cots on the floor if we really are stretched up to about 800 but its not ideal. To feed, coach, entertain, patch up, and make sure there is no funny business between the girls and boys side of these aproximatly 800 children we need between 150 - 200 staff. So I have nice round numbers I am going to use 800 campers and 200 staff when we are at max capacity at just this one location. 

From that 200 here is a short list of a few of the positions we need staffed to run:
- Circlium specific instructors - Ex. Gymnastics Coach
- Cabin Consolers - To make sure the campers brush your teeth and not stay up all night eating candy(a nearly impossible task).
- Chefs - To cook and serve the meals
- "Dish Dogs" - To clean up the messes after the meals
- Rec Directors - To orgizie fun events like the dance off, talent contest, and bon fire
- Arts and Crafts Instructors - So children can eat glue
- Trainers - To treat the atheletes aches and pains and occasional broken bones
- Nurses - To deal with puking children. Note: Since kids get sick 24/7 it requres multiple full time certified nurses so they can deal with sick children in shifts
- Ropes Course and Rock Climbing Instructors - So no one falls to their death druing arec activity
- Cantine/Coffee Shop Staff - To make sure the children have the ability to purchase everything they need to keep a constant sugar high
- Directors - To manage all the aformentione staff staff

## Training/Turnover - Mary Kay
Companies like Mary K are aplauded because of their ability to function with a (TODO: Research this + link to it) 25% a year turn over rate. 

Now lets contrast that with the off season the 40 weeks of the year when the original camp location houses 0 atheltes and is run by a staff of about 12 office people and grounds keepers. That means each year for 12 weeks you need to not just double 24, not just quadroopal 48, not even 10x your staff 120, but increase your workforce by aproximently 17x. 

If that is not bad enough only about 25%(50 people) of that staff will stay the whole summer. Out of the remaining 150 staff that fluxuate only 100 of those will be there for multiple weeks. That means that 25% of your work force turns over each week. 

Still impressed by Mary K's ability to be a profitable business after 25% year staff turn over when camp is crushing it with **25% a week**?

### Day 1 - at camp:
Your first day at camp starts by checking into the main office. They give you the staff handbook, give you some basic paperwork, and start
Each department also does its own day 1 training. Cheer has their own, Gymnastics another.

### Reading Assignment - Checklist Manifesto:
Process is essential for any business to scale. The trick is balencing process and creativity. Notice how they didn't go through and tell everyone day one how to coach a backward roll. There are hundres of ways to teach just about any skill. Each coach coaches slightly different, and each athelete learns slightly diferently so you need to get creative. The things that need processes are the mundain repetitive things or the essentials like safty. We have a bungi trampolien where campers wear a harnace that is strapped to bungis in addition to the trampolien. This has the added advantage of slowing the atheletes decent as they fall and reducing the impact on the ground. The bungis make it extreamly difficult for campers to get injured when used correctly. 

If used incorrectly then this can be a fairly dangerious activity. Campers with all types of backgrounds (not just gymnastics) are allowed to use it so that increaces the risk of injury. Because of these risks a very specific process is taught to all new staff that might endup working bungi at the begining of thier first week, as well as any that may have been caught not setting up correctly the previous week. 
- How to setup the bungi trampoline
- How to check an atheletes harnece
- How to instruct the athelete on the rules of the bungi
- How to strap an athelete in to the bungis
- How many bungis to use one atheletes of varying sizes
- How to launch an athelete in to their first series of bounces
- How to spot an athelete that may be about to land incorrectly
- Where to stand while the athelete is bouncing so you can intervine if neccisary
- How to stop an athelete from bouncing safly
- How to unbungi an anthlete
- How to take down and lock up the bungi trampolien at the end of a shift

Earlier I mentioned [The E-Myth by Michel E Gerber](TODO: Link to amazon) which does a great job of covering process and how to enforce consistant quality but for more check list specific information you should read [The Checklist Manifesto by XXX](TODO: Link in amazon). This covers a wide range of applications of process in checklists not just in business but in other fields like how doctors use them in hospitals to reduce risk during vital opperations.



### Hiarchy - Directors:
Camp has a simple hiarchy for managment. There is a General Manager and below them directors of each of the various departments. Each one with a fairly well defined scope of focus. These directors are in charge of exicuting or deligating tasks such as the following:
- Creating staff schedules
- Ensuring staff is where they need to be during a given shift
- Holding new staff training at the begining of each week.

### Lession:
Use managers effectivly

### Master Staff:

### Lession:
Leveradge your existing expirenced staff to help guide and train your newer staff members.

### Compensation Issues: Pays in education


### Applying it in your business:
Create an intern program of some type that pays in education. In my consulting business I hire junior/intern level people all the time to do the more simple tasks such as pixel pushing(Making small design adjustments) or repetive tasks such as making the same adjustment to a high number of services we have built.




### Departments/Cross Functional - 

### Hook-em young: JC Program - They become staff:
Camp created a program where they can give older campers a discount on their tuition for doing some basic cleaning work around camp. Some clean the gyms each night so the atheletes have a neat and clean enviroment to work out in. Others bus and clean dishes in the cafiteria. It is a mutually benficial way to help campers who want to spend more time at camp but dont have the big bucks to pay for it. 

The campers in this program, 16 or 17 years old work two weeks and get one week as their camper week. They pay only for the 1 camper week but get to stay all 3 weeks. Their cleaning assignments do not interfear with any scheduled traning times and most if not all of the rec activities. Their main duities are early in the morning or just after lights out at 10 pm. This also gives them the ability to stay out slightly past curfu which most enjoy so much that they often opt to work during their camper week. 

Beyond the obvious benifits of having an extreamly low cost workforce to do the tasks that I as a gym staff really would rather not do (sweeping and moping) it has the additional benifit that a high number of campers enrolled in this system become staff once they are too old to be campers. 

#### Lesson 1:




### Celeberties and their roll - Marketing - Not advertising which weeks:
