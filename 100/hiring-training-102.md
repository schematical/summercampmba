# Hiring/Training Staff 101:
One of the most difficult things I have ever done in my business is hiring and training staff. Admitedly I am not as good at is as I would like. That is why I have spent hours and hours studying over how camp has been able to be so successfull with it. 

## The Numbers:
Let me explain to you how vast and complex the staffing situation is at camp. At the original east coast location of camp our max capacity for campers is somewhere in the mid 700s children per week, we can put cots on the floor if we really are stretched up to about 800 but its not ideal. To feed, coach, entertain, patch up, and make sure there is no funny business between the girls and boys side of these aproximatly 800 children we need between 150 - 200 staff. So I have nice round numbers I am going to use 800 campers and 200 staff when we are at max capacity at just this one location. 

From that 200 here is a short list of a few of the positions we need staffed to run:
- Circlium specific instructors - Ex. Gymnastics Coach
- Cabin Consolers - To make sure the campers brush your teeth and not stay up all night eating candy(a nearly impossible task).
- Chefs - To cook and serve the meals
- "Dish Dogs" - To clean up the messes after the meals
- Rec Directors - To orgizie fun events like the dance off, talent contest, and bon fire
- Arts and Crafts Instructors - So children can eat glue
- Trainers - To treat the atheletes aches and pains and occasional broken bones
- Nurses - To deal with puking children. Note: Since kids get sick 24/7 it requres multiple full time certified nurses so they can deal with sick children in shifts
- Ropes Course and Rock Climbing Instructors - So no one falls to their death druing arec activity
- Cantine/Coffee Shop Staff - To make sure the children have the ability to purchase everything they need to keep a constant sugar high
- Directors - To manage all the aformentione staff staff

## Training/Turnover - Mary Kay
Companies like Mary K are aplauded because of their ability to function with a (TODO: Research this + link to it) 25% a year turn over rate. 

Now lets contrast that with the off season the 40 weeks of the year when the original camp location houses 0 atheltes and is run by a staff of about 12 office people and grounds keepers. That means each year for 12 weeks you need to not just double 24, not just quadroopal 48, not even 10x your staff 120, but increase your workforce by aproximently 17x. 

If that is not bad enough only about 25%(50 people) of that staff will stay the whole summer. Out of the remaining 150 staff that fluxuate only 100 of those will be there for multiple weeks. That means that 25% of your work force turns over each week. 

Still impressed by Mary K's ability to be a profitable business after 25% year staff turn over when camp is crushing it with **25% a week**?

### Compensation Issues: Pays in education



Hiarchy - Directors/Master Staff

Departments/Cross Functional - 

Hook-em young: JC Program - They become staff

Celeberties and their roll - Marketing - Not advertising which weeks
