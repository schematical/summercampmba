## Business Basics:
At its core a business performs one main function: To make the owners money. That sounds cold and harsh.

Fortunatly or unfortunatly(depending on your view) the cold hard fact its right now this day in age you need money 
Even in a barter economy you need something to barter. If you happen to live on acompletly self sufficent compound in the middle of nowhere I applaude you but you are most likely missing out on a lot of what the world has to offer. Also your probablly not reading this book becuase you would have had to barter to get it.

But think about it this way, pretty much no matter what you do: 
- Work in an office
- Work in a hospital
- Even work for the goverment(Arguablly)
- Work for a church?

You are performing a function that gives some body a valid reason to charge a fee, tax, tiding, etc.

## The purpose of your business and your life are two different things:
Understand the purpos of a business is to make its owners money, the purpose of your life should be something different entirly. So many people go through life 

## You do have a choice.
There is a saying: Your either working hard making your dreams or someone elses dreams come true.
Which would you prefer?

Owning your own business is not for everyone. Some people like being told what to do, when to start your work day, when to end it, when to take a break, and how to do your job.

I personally cant stand that type of thing. I need new challenges daily. My clients ask me for solutions.
Not to say you shouldn't take feed back from your clients/customers. Custmer feedback is super improtant, but there are some things the customer doesnt need to have a say in:
- When you start/finish your work day
- Where you do your work
- What you are wearing when you work

To prove my point as I write this it is a Saturday afternoon and I am sitting on a beach in Goa India enjoying a glass of wine. In a service business it is a little different but you still dictate these increadibly important details. 

I know owning a business is for me. Why? Again because I am sitting on a beach in Goa India enjoying a glass of wine, --so I can comfortably say owning my own business is for me--.

I will elaborate more on lifestyle business balence more in later chapters. For now just get really comfortable with the fact that 
1) You need money to live in modern society or you must get comfortable eating squerals you kill and rost over a fire
2) You can either work for someone else to make money and you will have to follow their rules or you can start your own business and make your own rules.

This book is for those of you that are intersted in the ladder.

## Maths
Math? Yuck I know right? Actually I love math, but I am a giant nerd. You may not, most people dont get excited about math... that is until you are tallying up your monthly profits and projecting growth that will allow you to take a year off and travel the globe or purchase that house that has the mindblowing view overlooking your favorite lake to take a dip in. Then math becomes fun. If you want to find yoru self in the aformentioned situation then I suggest you pay attention to the next section.
