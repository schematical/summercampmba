## Business Basics:
At its core a business performs one main function: To make the owners money. I know that sounds cold and harsh but let’s face facts: right now this day in age you need money to survive in our modern society.

Even in a barter economy you need something to barter. If you happen to live on completely self sufficient compound in the middle of nowhere I applaud you but you are most likely missing out on a lot of what the world has to offer. Also you're probably not reading this book because you would have had to barter to get it.

But think about it this way, pretty much no matter what you do: 
- Work in an office
- Work in a hospital
- Even work for the government(Arguably)
- Work for a church?

You are performing a function that gives somebody a valid reason to charge a fee, tax, tiding, etc.

## You do have a choice:
In a a little bit I will go over the concept of **Supply and Demand**. One thing that is in shorter and shorter supply everyday is time. Each day you spend working a job for someone else you have one less day to spend on this planet doing what you love doing. Each hour is one less hour you have to spend living and one more hour you give to making someone else's dream come true. How many more hours, days, months, years, decades are you going to squander before you realize that your time is worth more than the pittance you are getting paid at your (suitably titled) "day job"? If you are not careful your life will pass you buy in the blink of an eye. When you are on your deathbed how much of that day job money will you give back to looking back and smile because you spent your time your way one thinks you love doing. 

It's exactly that mental exercise of imagining me many years from now(ideally) propped up in a hospital bed with a smile on my face because I spent every summer at camp making hundreds if not thousands of children's dreams come true, knowing I spent my most important asset, my time, in the best possible way.

How many more hours will you spend before you change?


## The purpose of your business and your life are two different things:
Understand the purpose of a business is to make its owners money, the purpose of your life should be something different entirely. Many people go through life using their job title as a definition for their life. 

For years I made the majority of my income from running my consulting company that designed and built large scale web applications but when asked what “I did” I would often respond by telling them I was a “gymnastics coach” because that is what I was more passionate about. 

Work to live don't live to work - Translation: Don’t let your job title or even your business define your life. Define your the life you want to live and build a business around it that will support the lifestyle you want to live.

The founders at camp built a business that suited their lives. The Technician, now 74 years old and fully retired from the business with no responsibilities to camp still wanders through camp saying hi to old friends and making new ones. Imagine working on something you love so much that years after you retire from it you still have a desire to come down on a daily basis and hang out. They crafted something they truly loved in their life. I am sure there were days they would rather have stayed in bed, we all have those, but from my observation the vast majority of the time the founders and most of the staff were grateful to have camp in their life.

## Owning a business is not for everyone:

Owning your own business is not for everyone. Some people like being told what to do, when to start your work day, when to end it, when to take a break, and how to do your job.

I personally can't stand that type of thing. I need new challenges daily. My clients ask me for solutions.
Not to say you shouldn't take feedback from your clients/customers. Customer feedback is super important, but there are some things the customer doesn't need to have a say in:
- When you start/finish your work day
- Where you do your work
- What you are wearing when you work
- Etc

In a service business it is a little different but you still dictate these incredibly important details. 

If you are curing cancer and that is your life's purpose then by all means stay the course. If you were put on this earth to teach surfing in Australia and you currently spend more time hanging ten on a board then you do in doors: cowabunga dude. But if your like most people trying cram yourself into a 9-5 job wearing a uniform or much much worse khakis(Who thought those were a good idea?) then please, please, please, take this book and the other works I recommend seriously. You have one life to live. Don't deprive the world of your brilliances.


To prove my point as I write this it is a Saturday afternoon and I am sitting on a beach in Goa India enjoying a glass of wine so I can comfortably say owning a business is for me. 


I will elaborate more on lifestyle business balance more in later chapters. For now just get really comfortable with the following facts:

You need money to live in modern society or you must get comfortable eating squirrels you kill and roast over a fire
 You can either work for someone else to make money and you will have to follow their rules or you can start your own business and make your own rules.

This book is for those of you that are interested in the ladder.

[Thou Shall Prosper: Ten Commandments for Making Money - by Daniel Lapin](https://www.audible.com/pd/Religion-Spirituality/Thou-Shall-Prosper-Audiobook/B004BB2J1M)

If you are still struggling morally with the idea that you are going to create a business primarily for the purposes of making money then you need to stop and read **Thou Shall Prosper**. It breaks down quite a few moral arguments around the idea of making money. It looks at each moral issue from multiple angles and will help you understand that making money is not the worst thing that a person can do. If you make money then you can give money away, help your family, invest in helping others make their dreams come true, and spend it with other local businesses helping them thrive.

Disclaimer: I promise I wont get religious and preachy in this book but this first book does have a religious theme.


## Camp Economics:
Let’s examine the economics of camp. Where does money come from, where does it go to. Seems simple right? Let’s take a look.

### Where the money comes from:
Parents that want their children to have a fun filled week of summer while working towards improving an athletic or artistic skill set. They cut a check(depending on the week) for around $1000 for a single week.

That is the simple side of the equation.


### Where the money goes to:
The reason those numbers are so simple is because those that manage camp put forth the extraordinary amount of effort to make the following numbers all work out and that is why they can justify taking a profit.

- The mortgage, taxes and maintenance for the land camp is built on
- The wide variety of staff required to make each and every campers week there amazing
- The food the campers will eat
- The electricity, water, and other utilities required for the activities the campers will participate in


You as a business owner will have to take a wide variety of raw resources and services and combine them in a form of alchemy to create the product or service you will provide to your customer and the effort that goes into that alchemy is why you need to charge your profit margins. The beauty of running a business is that your time is no longer directly related to the units of product you sell as an employee: hours of your life.



## Maths
Math? Yuck I know right? Actually I love math, but I am a giant nerd. You may not, most people don't get excited about math... that is until you are tallying up your monthly profits and projecting growth that will allow you to take a year off and travel the globe or purchase that house that has the mindblowing view overlooking your favorite lake. That is when math becomes fun. If you want to find yourself in this situation then pay attention to the next section. 

### Disclaimer:
These numbers are strictly theoretical and for educational purposes. Sometimes I omit certain numbers in an effort to simplifies the example so it is easier for you to understand.

#### Gross Vs Net Revenue - 
_Grose Revinue_ is the amount of money camp makes in a given period of time before expenses are taken out(The expenses listed in the **Where the money goes to** section).  If camp takes in $1000 per camper per week and there are 800 campers at camp that week the_Gross Revinue_ would be $1000 * 800 = $800,000. (This is purely tuition revenue, not including ice cream, t-shirt sales, and all the other fun stuff campers can purchase).


_Net Revinue_ is what is left after expenses. It is also your profit. Lets say camp employs 100 staff per week at an average salary of $500/week that means you have $50,000 in expenses. 

For the moment I am going to ballpark some numbers to represent other potential expenses.

- $50,000 food
- $30,000 electricity + water + sewage
- $50,000 mortgage (Since money is only coming in 12 weeks of the year we will just say each week has to pay for 1 month of mortgage payments)
- $20,000 marketing costs (This again is a year long cost that I am averaging out like I did with the mortgage)

Totallying $150,000

I am sure there are many more expenses but for now let's stick with this simplified model. So adding in our $50,000 employee expenses to our $150,000 in other misc expenses we get a total expense of $200,000 per week. To get our total Net Revenue or Pre Tax Profit we need to subtract the total expenses from the Gross Revenue: $800,000 - $200,000 = $600,000. Not a bad profit.

Obviously you want the NET revenue to be as high as possible. When you first start your business your expenses will be quite simple but as time goes on and your business grows so will the complexities of these calculations. 

#### Expenses:
In the previous example you may have noticed that there were two types of expenses. Expenses that fluctuate based on how many campers there are and expenses that are fixed.

##### Per Unit:
Our per unit cost is the cost it takes to provide a single unit of our product or service. In camps case the units we are selling are weeks at camp(We also sell Ice Cream and a lot of other things but to keep our example simple lets focus on camper weeks).

What costs fluctuate the more camper weeks we sell?

- Staff costs go up because we need more staff to teach and supervise the campers
- Food costs go up because we need to feed the campers and staff
- Utility consumption goes up as well

These are just a few examples of Per Unit costs.

##### Fixed Overhead:
Fixed Overhead is stuff like the mortgage. Since we have already purchased the land and have an agreement to pay a fixed monthly cost to the bank that number does not changed based on the number of campers that enjoy a week at camp.

Overhead can represent other things that cannot directly be attributed to a per unit cost.

When you design your business model you will have to take both types of expenses into account.


#### Cash Flow
"Cash is king"
Cashflow is a really important concept you need to understand. Cashflow is the quantity of money coming in vs going out. Having a contract with a client or customer is like having an IOU. On paper you have money coming in but you can't really pay your bills with an IOU. Cash Flow is an accurate measurement of real money in vs real money out. As a young euntripinure I did not fully understand this concept and it came back to bite me more than once.

##### Cash Flow Positive:
This is when you have more cash coming in then you have going out. (This is pretty much always a good thing)

##### Cash Flow Negative:
This is the opposite. This is bad unless it is caused by making an investment back into your business and you have ample cash to fall back on.


Businesses often fluctuate between the two states depending on if you are aggressively pursuing growth or suffering from a recession in business.

##### Net X:
The term for how many days it takes for a client to pay is called "Net" so if for example you have NET 30 terms that means the client has 30 days to pay before penalties can be introduced. 
As an employee typical 9-5 job if you get paid every other week you are cashflow NET 14 .

Where things get tough: Assuming your clients do pay and don't screw around you could have a business that gets paid NET 30 terms(with in 30 days of services rendered) which is fairly standard but you need to pay your employees NET 14. This means for a good chunk of each month you are cash flow negative. If you do not have a nice stockpile of cash then you will find yourself in hot water each month.

This is similar to allowing people to pay on the installment plan. It's great if the client pays but that doesn't always happen. I have had clients come up with every excuse you can imagine and even ask me after the fact to reduce my rate or shave off some hours. I no longer work with that type of joker and suggest you never leave yourself open to such ridiculous behavior. Unfortunately depending on your business model this is sometimes inevitable that you will have to bill after the work is done. 
In the sections below I will share some ways to mitigate risk if this is absolutely necessary. 


##### "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush":
There is nothing better than money up front(unless you are a bank or loan shark and make your money on interest percentages). 
Those who run camp are much smarter than I was and since day one Camp has had a NET 0 policy. This means that as soon as you show up you need to be 100% settled up for the week. They even do one better and give discounts for those that signup and pay ahead of time. This means that camp can even further limit its exposure when committing to hire staff for the upcoming summer by looking at the amount of customers that have already paid in full and using that number to determine how many staff they will need even if a significant amount of campers don't show up and pay their remaining balance.



#### R.O.I:
//TODO: ROI


### Applying it in the "Real World":
#### Gross Revenue:
Let's say I have a junior software developer on payroll at $25/hr and I mark his time up to $50/hr. They work 40 hours in a week. That means my Gross revenue is 40 x $50 = $2000 that week. And I need to pay the employee 40 x $25 which comes out to $1000. That leaves $1000 not counting our fixed overhead and a bunch of taxes. 

This is also an example of a really simple example of per unit overhead. Since what I am selling is the Junior Developer's hours the per unit overhead is fixed at $25/$50.

PS: Later I will get into why this is a bad idea and I never sell my own hours.


#### Overhead:
##### Per Unit:
As I said above in my consulting business my per unit overhead is mainly hours or for my senior staff that do call weekly retainers(its kinda like salary that requires us to be available for servers that start fire). 

##### Fixed:
My fixed overhead is my administrative staff that don’t create billable hours which I pay on salary, several online services we use such as our online invoicing and accounting tool, our internal chat, our internal project management software, etc. 

Some of these services, specifically ones that charge per user, are not technically fixed since I am limited by the hours I can sell based on my staff. More staff with hours to sell equals more users so it's a scalable cost. If you have a product business this relationship is not so linear. 

A more clear example of these two principals might be the book you are reading right now: SummerCampMBA. 
My fixed costs are the cost of my time to create this, the cost of the editors time, the cost of the cover designers, etc.
My per unit costs are actually 0 as amazon prints and fulfills all of the books on demand. Before the amazing invention of print on demand there would be a per unit cost that was a fraction of each books cost.

#### Cashflow:
##### Net Terms:

##### "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush" part 2:
In my consulting business for my unpredictable hours I typically do NET 14 at the most which corresponds with my 2 week employee payroll cycle and as you will see I do NET -7 for my higher level and more costly staff that are billed out at a fixed weekly rate meaning that the client pays a week upfront as a deposit before we even start the project. This pushes the risk from them to me. If the client ever got behind on payments they had already paid a week in advance and we would just stop work and keep use the advance to pay my staff for services previously rendered.



##### Another warning story:
One of my clients somehow let their clients creep from NET 90 to NET 180 to NET 360. This means that their client was over a year behind. My client still had to pay us out of pocket NET 14(actually I had them put down a down payment so they were NET -7 because I don't play around like that). That means they were cash flow negative for a solid year. This is pretty insane, at this point they were acting more as a bank then a service provider. 



##### When is NET365 good?
When is an insanely long net good? The answer is when you are NOT the one taking the debt on(again unless you are a bank or a loan shark and that is your core business model). Let me tell you a little story about one of my clients that sold car parts online. They did alright and stuck to the same rules that I do. Get the money up front then ship the product. That is until one day a payment provider decided they wanted to get into the lending game. My auto part selling client coded in this new paypal like loan system and launched it. The next day they did double the business they had ever done before and it continued to grow. The payment provider provided the liberal payment terms to the end customer and my auto part paying customer got paid immediately regardless of whether or not the end customer payed down the line allowing my client to take in the cash and remain cash flow positive. The increase in customers was so significant that he had to hire my company to keep up with the scale. Of course I charged him a a retainer up front and NET 14 for any hourly work.

[Found Money: Simple Strategies for Uncovering the Hidden Profit and Cash Flow in Your Business - by Steve Wilkinghoff](https://www.amazon.com/Found-Money-Strategies-Uncovering-Business/dp/0470483350) 

This book was introduced to me by one of my mentors, the owner of my home gym that I coach at when I am not at camp. It is a great introduction for any novice business owner into basic cash flow accounting and transitioning to the more advanced topics.

### Reading Assignment 2:
[Built to Sell: Creating a Business That Can Thrive Without You – by John Warrillow](https://www.amazon.com/Built-Sell-Creating-Business-Without/dp/1591845823)

This book blew my mind the first time I read it. It helped me turn my cash flow negative service business into a more productized cash flow positive before day 1 business. This book was so crucial to me shifting the risk off of my business and making sure I had the cash to pay my costs before rendering a single hour of service out of pocket.


## Conclusion:
Get comfortable with making money, there is no shame in it if you make it and spend it ethically. Get to know the math behind your business and your industry. Math it becomes a lot more fun when it is funding your lifestyle.
