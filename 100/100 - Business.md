## Business Basics:
At its core a business performs one main function: To make the owners money. That sounds cold and harsh.

Fortunatly or unfortunatly(depending on your view) the cold hard fact its right now this day in age you need money 
Even in a barter economy you need something to barter. If you happen to live on acompletly self sufficent compound in the middle of nowhere I applaude you but you are most likely missing out on a lot of what the world has to offer. Also your probablly not reading this book becuase you would have had to barter to get it.

But think about it this way, pretty much no matter what you do: 
- Work in an office
- Work in a hospital
- Even work for the goverment(Arguablly)
- Work for a church?

You are performing a function that gives somebody a valid reason to charge a fee, tax, tiding, etc.

## The purpose of your business and your life are two different things:
Understand the purpos of a business is to make its owners money, the purpose of your life should be something different entirly. So many people go through life 

## You do have a choice.
There is a saying: Your either working hard making your dreams or someone elses dreams come true.
Which would you prefer?

## Supply and Demand - Time:
//TODO Tie this in better this is a big concept
In this book I will talk alot about supply and demand. 
One thing that is in shorter and shorter supply everyday is time. Each day you spend working a job for someone else you have one less day to spend on this planet doing what you love doing. Each hour is one less hour you have to spend living and one more hour you give to making someone elses dream come true. How many more hours, days, months, years, decaids are you going to squander before you realize that your time is worth more than the pittance you are getting paid at your (suitably titled) "day job"? If you are not careful your life will pass you buy in the blink of an eye. When you are on your death bed how much of that day job money will you give back to looking back and smile because you spent your time your way on thinks you love doing. 

Its excactly that mental exercise of imagining me many years from now(ideally) propped up in a hospital bed with a smile on my lips because I spent ever summer at camp making hundreds if not thousands of childrens dreams come true, knowing I spent my most important asset, my time, in the best possible way.

How many more hours will you spend before you change?


## Owning a business is not for everyone:

Owning your own business is not for everyone. Some people like being told what to do, when to start your work day, when to end it, when to take a break, and how to do your job.

I personally cant stand that type of thing. I need new challenges daily. My clients ask me for solutions.
Not to say you shouldn't take feed back from your clients/customers. Custmer feedback is super improtant, but there are some things the customer doesnt need to have a say in:
- When you start/finish your work day
- Where you do your work
- What you are wearing when you work
- When and how you get paid(see the **Cash Flow** section below for why this is improtant)

If you are curing cancer and that is your lifes purpose then by all means stay the course. If you were put on this earth to teach surfing in Austrailia and you currently spend more time hanging ten on a board then you do in doors then cowabunga dude. But if your like most people trying cram your self into a 9-5 job wearing a uniform or much much worse kackies(Who thought those were a good idea?) then please, please, please, take this book and the other works I recomend seriously. You have one life to live. Don't deprive the world of your brilliances.


To prove my point as I write this it is a Saturday afternoon and I am sitting on a beach in Goa India enjoying a glass of wine. In a service business it is a little different but you still dictate these increadibly important details. 


### Owning a business is not for everyone:
I know owning a business is for me. Why? Again because I am sitting on a beach in Goa India enjoying a glass of wine, --so I can comfortably say owning my own business is for me--.

I will elaborate more on lifestyle business balence more in later chapters. For now just get really comfortable with the fact that 
1) You need money to live in modern society or you must get comfortable eating squerals you kill and rost over a fire
2) You can either work for someone else to make money and you will have to follow their rules or you can start your own business and make your own rules.

This book is for those of you that are intersted in the ladder.

[Thou Shall Prosper: Ten Commandments for Making Money - by Daniel Lapin](https://www.audible.com/pd/Religion-Spirituality/Thou-Shall-Prosper-Audiobook/B004BB2J1M)

I promise I wont get religious and preachy in this book. If you are still struggling morally with the idea that you are going to create a business primarily for the purposes of making money then you need to stop and read **Thou Shall Prosper**. It breaks down quite a few moral arguments around the idea of making money. It looks at each moral issue from multiple angles and will help you understand that making money is not the worst thing that a person can do. If you make money then you can give money away, help your family, invest in helping others make their dreams come true, and spend it with other local businesses. 


## Camp Economics:
Lets examine the economics of camp. Where does money come from, where does it go to. Seems simple right? Lets take a look.

### Where the money comes from:
Parents that want their children to have a fun filled week of summer while working twards improving an athletic or artistic skillset. They cut a check(depending on the week) for around $1000 for a single week.

That is the simple side of the equasion.


### Where the money goes to:
The reason those numbers are so simple is beacause those that manage camp do the effort to make the following numbers all work out and that is why they can justify taking their cut of the profit.

- The mortage, taxes and maintaince for the land camp is built on
- the wide variety of staff required to make each and every campers week there amazing(Including me)
- The food the campers will eat
- The electricty, water, and other utilities required for the activities the campers will participate in
- 

Coordinating all of the above takes an extrodinary amount of effort and that is why the owners of camp can justify taking aprofit.


You as a business owner will have to take a wide variety of raw resources and services and combine them in a form of alchemy to create the product or service you will provide to your customer and the effort that goes into that alchemy is why you need to charge your profit margins. The beauty of running a business is that your time is no longer directly related to the units of product you sell as an employee: hours of your life.



## Maths
Math? Yuck I know right? Actually I love math, but I am a giant nerd. You may not, most people dont get excited about math... that is until you are tallying up your monthly profits and projecting growth that will allow you to take a year off and travel the globe or purchase that house that has the mindblowing view overlooking your favorite lake to take a dip in. Then math becomes fun. If you want to find yoru self in the aformentioned situation then I suggest you pay attention to the next section. 

#### Gross Vs Net Revinue - 
_Grose Revinue_ is the amount of money camp makes in a given period of time before expenses are taken out(The expenses listed in the **Where the money goes to** section).  If camp takes in $1000 per camper per week and lets say there are 800 campers at camp that week their _Gross Revinue_ would be $1000 * 800 = $800,000. (Not including icecream, t-shirt sales, and all the other fun stuff campers can purchase).


_Net Revinue_ is what is left after expenses. It is also your profit. Lets say camp employees 100 staff per week at an averedge salary of $500/week that means you have $50,000 in expenses. 

For the moment I am going to pull some numbers out of thin air to represnet other potential expenses.

- $50,000 food
- $30,000 electricty + water + sewage
- $50,000 morgage (Since money is only coming in 12 weeks of the year we will just say each week has to pay for 1 month of mortage payments)
- $20,000 marketing costs (This again is a year long cost that I am averedging out like I did with the mortage)

Totallying $150,000

I am sure there are many more expenses but for now lets stick with this simplified model. So adding in our $50,000 employee expenses to our $150,000 in other misc expenses we get a total expense of $200,000 per week. To get our total Net Revinue or Pre Tax Profit we need to subtract the total expenses from the Gross Revinue: $800,000 - $200,000 = $600,000. Not bad

When you first start your business your expnses will be quite simple but as time goes on and your business grows so will the complexities of these calculations. 
Obviously you want the NET revinue to be as high as possible

#### Expenses:
Overhead just another term for our costs/expenses.
In the previous example you may have noticed that there were two types of expenses. Expenses that fluctuate based on how many campers there are and expenses that are fixed.
##### Per Unit:
Our per unit cost is the cost it takes to provide a single unit of our product or service. In camps case the units we are selling are weeks at camp(We also sell Ice Cream and a lot of other things but to keep our example simple lets focus on camper weeks).

What costs fluctuate the more camper weeks we sell?

- Staff costs go up because we need more staff to teach and supervise the campers
- Food costs go up because we need to feed the campers and staff
- Utility consumption goes up as well

These are just afew examples of Per Unit costs

##### Fixed Overhead:
Fixed Overhead is stuff like the morgage. Since we have already purchased the land and have an agreement to pay a fixed monthly cost to the bank that number does not changed based on the number of campers that enjoy a week at camp.

Overhead can represnet other things that cannot directly be attriputed to a per unit cost.

When you design your business model you will have to take both types of expenses into account.


#### Cash Flow
"Cash is king"
Cashflow is a really important concept you need to understand. Cashlflow is the quantity of money coming in vs going out. Having a contract with a client or customer is like having an IOU. On paper you have money coming in but you can't really pay your bills with an IOU. Cash Flow is an accurate measurement of real money in vs real money out. As a young euntripinure I did not fully understand this concept and it came back to bite me in the ass me more than once.

##### Cash Flow Positive:
This is when you have more cash coming in then you have going out. (This is pretty much always a good thing)

##### Cash Flow Negative:
This is obviously the opposite. This is pretty much always a bad thing unless you are intending to scam the IRS.


Businesses often fluctuate between the two states depending on if you are agressivly pursuing growth or suffering from a ressision in business.



Lets look at my business. For my junior developers they might be required to work 10 hours a week on project A and 30 on project B but we don't know that in advance so I have to charge after the work is performed. This means that often times I have to pay my employees before payment is recived from the clients. Not just employees but all types of service providers, landlords, etc.

This is similar to allowing people to pay on the installment plan. Its great if the client pays but that doesnt always happen. I have had clients come up with every excuse you can imagine and even ask me after the fact to reduce my rate or shave off some hours. I no longer work with that type of joker and suggest you never leave your self open to such rediclious behavior. Unfortunatly depending on your business model this is some times inevitable that you will have to bill after the work is done. 
In the sections below I will share some ways to mitiagte risk if this is absolutly neccissary. 




## Net X:
The term for how many days it takes for a client to pay is called "Net" so if for example you have NET 30 terms that means the client has 30 days to pay before penalties can be introduced. 
As an employee typical 9-5 job if you get payed every other week you are cashflow NET 14 .

Where things get tough: Assuming your clients do pay and dont screw around you could have a business that gets paid NET 30 terms but you need to pay your employees NET 14. This means for a good chunk of each month you are cashflow negatitive. If you do not have a nice stock pile of cash then you will find yourself in hot water each month.





## "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush" part 1:
There is nothing better then money up front(unless you are a bank or loan shark and make your money on interest percentages). 
Those who run camp are much smarter then I was and since day one Camp has had a NET 0 policy. This means that as soon as you show up you need to be 100% settled up for the week. They even do 1 better and give discounts for those that signup and pay a head of time. This means that camp can even further limit its exposure when committing to hire staff for the up coming summer by looking at the amount of customers that have already payed in full and using that number to determine how many staff they will need even if a significant amount of campers don't show up and pay their remaining balence.

#### R.O.I:


### Applying it in the "Real World":
#### Gross Revinue:
Lets say I have a junior developer on payrole at $25/hr and I mark his time up to $50/hr. They work 40 hours in a week. That means my Gross revinue is 40 x $50 = $2000 that week. And I need to pay the employee 40 x $25 which comes out to $1000. That leaves $1000 not counting our fixed overhead and a bunch of taxes. 

This is also an example of a really simple example of per unit overhead. Since what I am selling is the Junior Developer's hours the per unit overhead is fixed at $25/$50.

PS: Later I will get into why this is a bad idea and I never sell my own hours.




#### Overhead:
##### Per Unit:
As I said above in my consulting business my per unit overhead is mainly hours or for my senior staff that do call weekly retainers(its kinda like salary that requires us to be available for servers that start fire). 

##### Fixed:
My fixed overhead is ocassionally an office, several online services we use such as our online invoicing and accounting tool, our internal chat, our internal project managment software, etc. Some of these services, spicifically ones that charge per user, are not technically fixed since I am limited by the hours I can sell based on my staff. More staff with hours to sell equals more users so its a scalable cost. If you have a product business this relationship is not so linear. 

A more clear example of these two principals might be this book. 
My fixed costs are the cost of my time to create this, the cost of the editors time, the cost of the cover designers.
My per unit costs are actually 0 as amazon prints and fulfills all of the books on demand. Before the amazing invention of print on demand there would be a perunit cost that was a fraction of each books cost.

#### Cashflow:
##### Net Terms:
Another warning story: One of my clients some how let their clients for a project creep from NET 90 to NET 180 to NET 360. This means that their client was over a year behind. My client still had to pay us out of pocket(because I dont play around like that). That means they were cashflow negative for a solid year. This is pretty insane, at this point they were acting more as a bank then a service providor. 


##### "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush" part 1:
For my unperdictable hours I typically do NET 14 at the most which corrosponds with my 2 week employee payroll cycle and as you will see I do NET -7 for my higher level and more costly staff meaning that the client pays up front. Since the junior developers hours repisent a strong minority of our overall revinue I never end up cashflow negatitive with the consulting business.


##### When is NET 365 good?
When is an insainly long net good? The answer is when you are not the one taking the debt on(again unless you are a bank or a loan shark and that is your core business model). Let me tell you a little story about one of my clients that sold car parts online. They did alright and stuck to the same rules that I do. Get the money up front then ship the product. Until one day a payment providor deciceded they wanted to get into the lending game. My auto part selling client wired in the new paypal loan system and launched. The next day they did double the business they had ever done before. The payment providor provided the liberal payment terms to the end customer and my auto part paying cusotomer got payed imediatly regardless of weather or not the end customer payed down the line allowing my client to take in the cash and remain cashflow positive. The increase in customers was so significant that he had to hire my company to keep up with the scale. Of course I charged him a a retainer up front and NET 14 for any hourly work.
