## Business Basics:
At its core a business performs one main function: To make the owners money. That sounds cold and harsh.

Fortunatly or unfortunatly(depending on your view) the cold hard fact its right now this day in age you need money 
Even in a barter economy you need something to barter. If you happen to live on acompletly self sufficent compound in the middle of nowhere I applaude you but you are most likely missing out on a lot of what the world has to offer. Also your probablly not reading this book becuase you would have had to barter to get it.

But think about it this way, pretty much no matter what you do: 
- Work in an office
- Work in a hospital
- Even work for the goverment(Arguablly)
- Work for a church?

You are performing a function that gives some body a valid reason to charge a fee, tax, tiding, etc.

## The purpose of your business and your life are two different things:
Understand the purpos of a business is to make its owners money, the purpose of your life should be something different entirly. So many people go through life 

## You do have a choice.
There is a saying: Your either working hard making your dreams or someone elses dreams come true.
Which would you prefer?

Owning your own business is not for everyone. Some people like being told what to do, when to start your work day, when to end it, when to take a break, and how to do your job.

I personally cant stand that type of thing. I need new challenges daily. My clients ask me for solutions.

As I write this I am sitting on a beach in Goa India enjoying a glass of wine, so I can comfortably say owning my own business is for me.
