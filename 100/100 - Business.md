## Business Basics:
At its core a business performs one main function: To make the owners money. That sounds cold and harsh.

Fortunatly or unfortunatly(depending on your view) the cold hard fact its right now this day in age you need money 
Even in a barter economy you need something to barter. If you happen to live on acompletly self sufficent compound in the middle of nowhere I applaude you but you are most likely missing out on a lot of what the world has to offer. Also your probablly not reading this book becuase you would have had to barter to get it.

But think about it this way, pretty much no matter what you do: 
- Work in an office
- Work in a hospital
- Even work for the goverment(Arguablly)
- Work for a church?

You are performing a function that gives some body a valid reason to charge a fee, tax, tiding, etc.

## The purpose of your business and your life are two different things:
Understand the purpos of a business is to make its owners money, the purpose of your life should be something different entirly. So many people go through life 

## You do have a choice.
There is a saying: Your either working hard making your dreams or someone elses dreams come true.
Which would you prefer?

Owning your own business is not for everyone. Some people like being told what to do, when to start your work day, when to end it, when to take a break, and how to do your job.

I personally cant stand that type of thing. I need new challenges daily. My clients ask me for solutions.
Not to say you shouldn't take feed back from your clients/customers. Custmer feedback is super improtant, but there are some things the customer doesnt need to have a say in:
- When you start/finish your work day
- Where you do your work
- What you are wearing when you work
- When and how you get paid(see the **Cash Flow** section below for why this is improtant)

To prove my point as I write this it is a Saturday afternoon and I am sitting on a beach in Goa India enjoying a glass of wine. In a service business it is a little different but you still dictate these increadibly important details. 

I know owning a business is for me. Why? Again because I am sitting on a beach in Goa India enjoying a glass of wine, --so I can comfortably say owning my own business is for me--.

I will elaborate more on lifestyle business balence more in later chapters. For now just get really comfortable with the fact that 
1) You need money to live in modern society or you must get comfortable eating squerals you kill and rost over a fire
2) You can either work for someone else to make money and you will have to follow their rules or you can start your own business and make your own rules.

This book is for those of you that are intersted in the ladder.

[Thou Shall Prosper: Ten Commandments for Making Money - by Daniel Lapin](https://www.audible.com/pd/Religion-Spirituality/Thou-Shall-Prosper-Audiobook/B004BB2J1M)

I promise I wont get religious and preachy in this book. If you are still struggling morally with the idea that you are going to create a business primarily for the purposes of making money then you need to stop and read **Thou Shall Prosper**. It breaks down quite a few moral arguments around the idea of making money. It looks at each moral issue from multiple angles and will help you understand that making money is not the worst thing that a person can do. If you make money then you can give money away, help your family, invest in helping others make their dreams come true, and spend it with other local businesses. 


## Camp Economics:
Lets examine the economics of camp. Where does money come from, where does it go to. Seems simple right? Lets take a look
- Where the money comes from
- Where the money goes to


## Maths
Math? Yuck I know right? Actually I love math, but I am a giant nerd. You may not, most people dont get excited about math... that is until you are tallying up your monthly profits and projecting growth that will allow you to take a year off and travel the globe or purchase that house that has the mindblowing view overlooking your favorite lake to take a dip in. Then math becomes fun. If you want to find yoru self in the aformentioned situation then I suggest you pay attention to the next section. 
#### Gross Vs Net Revinue - 
#### R.O.I.
#### Overhead
- Fixed
- Per Unit
#### Cash Flow
"Cash is king"
Cashflow is a really important concept you need to understand. Cashlflow is the quantity of money coming in vs going out. Having a contract with a client or customer is like having an IOU. On paper you have money coming in but you can't really pay your bills with an IOU. Cash Flow is an accurate measurement of real money in vs real money out. As a young euntripinure I did not fully understand this concept and it came back to bite me in the ass me more than once.

##### Cash Flow Positive:
This is when you have more cash coming in then you have going out. (This is pretty much always a good thing)

##### Cash Flow Negative:
This is obviously the opposite. This is pretty much always a bad thing unless you are intending to scam the IRS.


Businesses often fluctuate between the two states depending on if you are agressivly pursuing growth or suffering from a ressision in business.



Lets look at my business. For my junior developers they might be required to work 10 hours a week on project A and 30 on project B but we don't know that in advance so I have to charge after the work is performed. This means that often times I have to pay my employees before payment is recived from the clients. Not just employees but all types of service providers, landlords, etc.

This is similar to allowing people to pay on the installment plan. Its great if the client pays but that doesnt always happen. I have had clients come up with every excuse you can imagine and even ask me after the fact to reduce my rate or shave off some hours. I no longer work with that type of joker and suggest you never leave your self open to such rediclious behavior. Unfortunatly depending on your business model this is some times inevitable that you will have to bill after the work is done. 
In the sections below I will share some ways to mitiagte risk if this is absolutly neccissary. 




## Net X:
The term for how many days it takes for a client to pay is called "Net" so if for example you have NET 30 terms that means the client has 30 days to pay before penalties can be introduced. 
As an employee typical 9-5 job if you get payed every other week you are cashflow NET 14 .

Where things get tough: Assuming your clients do pay and dont screw around you could have a business that gets paid NET 30 terms but you need to pay your employees NET 14. This means for a good chunk of each month you are cashflow negatitive. If you do not have a nice stock pile of cash then you will find yourself in hot water each month.





## "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush" part 1:
There is nothing better then money up front(unless you are a bank or loan shark and make your money on interest percentages). 
Those who run camp are much smarter then I was and since day one Camp has had a NET 0 policy. This means that as soon as you show up you need to be 100% settled up for the week. They even do 1 better and give discounts for those that signup and pay a head of time. This means that camp can even further limit its exposure when committing to hire staff for the up coming summer by looking at the amount of customers that have already payed in full and using that number to determine how many staff they will need even if a significant amount of campers don't show up and pay their remaining balence.




### Applying it in the "Real World":
#### Gross Revinue:
Lets say I have a junior developer on payrole at $25/hr and I mark his time up to $50/hr. They work 40 hours in a week. That means my Gross revinue is 40 x $50 = $2000 that week. And I need to pay the employee 40 x $25 which comes out to $1000. That leaves $1000 not counting our fixed overhead and a bunch of taxes. 

This is also an example of a really simple example of per unit overhead. Since what I am selling is the Junior Developer's hours the per unit overhead is fixed at $25/$50.

PS: Later I will get into why this is a bad idea and I never sell my own hours.

#### ROI:
//TODO: Figure this out


#### Overhead:
##### Per Unit:
As I said above in my consulting business my per unit overhead is mainly hours or for my senior staff that do call weekly retainers(its kinda like salary that requires us to be available for servers that start fire). 

##### Fixed:
My fixed overhead is ocassionally an office, several online services we use such as our online invoicing and accounting tool, our internal chat, our internal project managment software, etc. Some of these services, spicifically ones that charge per user, are not technically fixed since I am limited by the hours I can sell based on my staff. More staff with hours to sell equals more users so its a scalable cost. If you have a product business this relationship is not so linear. 

A more clear example of these two principals might be this book. 
My fixed costs are the cost of my time to create this, the cost of the editors time, the cost of the cover designers.
My per unit costs are actually 0 as amazon prints and fulfills all of the books on demand. Before the amazing invention of print on demand there would be a perunit cost that was a fraction of each books cost.

#### Cashflow:
##### Net Terms:
Another warning story: One of my clients some how let their clients for a project creep from NET 90 to NET 180 to NET 360. This means that their client was over a year behind. My client still had to pay us out of pocket(because I dont play around like that). That means they were cashflow negative for a solid year. This is pretty insane, at this point they were acting more as a bank then a service providor. 


##### "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush" part 1:
For my unperdictable hours I typically do NET 14 at the most which corrosponds with my 2 week employee payroll cycle and as you will see I do NET -7 for my higher level and more costly staff meaning that the client pays up front. Since the junior developers hours repisent a strong minority of our overall revinue I never end up cashflow negatitive with the consulting business.


##### When is NET 365 good?
When is an insainly long net good? The answer is when you are not the one taking the debt on(again unless you are a bank or a loan shark and that is your core business model). Let me tell you a little story about one of my clients that sold car parts online. They did alright and stuck to the same rules that I do. Get the money up front then ship the product. Until one day a payment providor deciceded they wanted to get into the lending game. My auto part selling client wired in the new paypal loan system and launched. The next day they did double the business they had ever done before. The payment providor provided the liberal payment terms to the end customer and my auto part paying cusotomer got payed imediatly regardless of weather or not the end customer payed down the line allowing my client to take in the cash and remain cashflow positive. The increase in customers was so significant that he had to hire my company to keep up with the scale. Of course I charged him a a retainer up front and NET 14 for any hourly work.
