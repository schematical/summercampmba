## History 101 - Getting Started:


One of the lessons you will learn is to ask forgiveness, not permission. Since I live by that and have not asked permission I will write this more as a fable then a completely biographical recap. That means the names and details have been changed to protect... me from getting sued. 

At the start our story follows two amazing brilliant individuals. The original founder that started this whole thing in 1970 I will refer to as **The Technician**.  The secondary founder that arrived on the scene and to this day acts as CEO I will refer to as **The Entrepreneur**.

## Reading Assignment: [The E-Myth by Michael Gerber](TODO:LINK):
I did not pick the names of our two main characters at random. The E-Myth defines anyone involved with a business as one of the following arch types:

### Technician:
The technician is the person that does the technical work that results in the end product. For example in a restaurant that would be the chef. In the case of running a gym this is the class teacher, or the team coach.

### Entrepreneur:
This is the person that has the bright(or terrible) idea to start a business. The one that sees a need and decides to fill it. The individual with the guts to sail uncharted territories and the hutsva to make cold call after cold call until they get the first few sales. 

This could be the restaurant owner that raises the capital then rents a venue and hires a staff. It is no different in the gym owners world.

### Manager:
The Manager comes into play a little later in the picture. After you have a few steady customers and you need to hire more technicians to start building more of your product, cooking more meals, or teaching more beginner tumbling classes and you need someone to manage your growing workforce you bring in a Manager. There will be a character in our story called “The Manager” but not for a few more decades. 


Anyone might be two out of three but typically one talent is more dominant then the others. Because of this I describe the original founder as the technician not because he had no Entrepreneur traits, but instead because the secondary founder that came in around 1975 had a complete lack of Technician traits; which instantly gave him a huge advantage. 






## 1970:
Our story starts with the Technician a young man in his late 20s. A collegiate athlete that loved his sport: gymnastics. He had a vision(an Entrepreneur traits) of starting a summer camp that taught his favorite sport. He went around to various groups in his community and started to pitch his idea. Eventually he raised a little capital from members of his church and found a nice affordable farm about 45 minutes drive from the college he competed at. 

He grabbed a handful of friends, and aspiring athletes and went to work converting this farm into a children's summer camp. It took about a year of work to build the cabins, setup a dining hall, assemble the training facility, and even shovel out a large amount of cow manure from under the main barn. 

The Technician used his modest fame gained by being a popular collegiate athlete to market the camp to the local youth. Children who aspire to someday be a collegiate athlete like he was. A handful of aspiring male and female athletes signed up for this new camp and he started to receive his first checks and was able to fund further development and staff costs for the camp.

Weeks before the camp was scheduled to have its first camper week they frantically worked to finish assembling what was left of camp. They just barely managed to make it livable with several temporary 'hacks' in place and they managed to launch. 

The first summer went off with, well many hitches. In the end they managed to push through and make a lot of amazing experiences for their campers and a lot of happy customers.  Lots of painful lessons were learned the hard way. 

There were several pleasant surprises, like when they found out that the elevated wooden floor of the barn had more flexibility than your standard gymnasium floor. This was way before the modern spring floors you see now existed. When athletes tumbled on this barn floor because of the give it had it acted like a trampoline giving the athletes a good boost on each tumbling pass; a boost that allowed them to do bigger skills then they could at any other gym. The Technician had accidently invented an early version of the "spring floor" which is now standard at every gymnastics gym and competition in the world.

Another pleasant surprise was due to the location of camp. Located in a fairly population dense section of the east coast of the United States there were plenty of athletes with in a drivable distance of camp. So once word spread about this amazing new place(and its magic floor) athletes from all over started flocking to camp.






## Lesson: Just start
_"The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago. The second best time is now"_ Often times toughest part to starting any business, or anything is just to start, to take the leap of faith and see what happens. It's the same as doing any big gymnastics skill. Often times just making up your mind and committing to going for the big skill that first time is the toughest decision. 

I am not recommending blindly chucking skills, but instead break it down in to its smallest pieces and start one at a time. 
In gymnastics we call them progressions:
- Drill 1
- Drill 2
- Drill 3
- Try the skill 

In the story of our founder those progressions were as follows:
- Find and secure the capital
- Find and secure the property
- Find and hire the staff
- Build the dream
- Run the first summer at camp

If he had not started reaching out to members of his community to raise the money then none of this would have ever existed. He just started and never stopped.


//TODO: Earlier add disclaimer that the book is dedicated to my athletes so there are a lot of athletic and some gymnastic specific examples but it should be easy to stomach.

### Start with what you know:
The Technician had spent a lot of his youth honing his skills as an athlete and a coach. He had a huge depth of knowledge on the field, and knew how to produce the results young athletes and their parents(the ones with the check books) desired.

### Start with who you know:
He started with who he knew: First he reached raised money by reaching out to people in his various community groups that might be interested and ended up locking in financing from someone he knew through church. Then he hired his first staff members from his circle of friends and current team members of his alma mater as staff.

### Start with where you know:
The Technician picked a spot within an hours drive from an area he knew and was known really well so he could draw on all of the resources from that area. This is not necessarily limited to geographic location. Since  even at a young gymnasts travel significant distances often times to other states to compete age he used his contacts in the Gymnastics world to connect with potential customers hundreds of miles away from the camp. Now days with the internet that could be any place where people know you or you have connections. 

### Start with what you have:
The Technician did NOT have a massive marketing budget or a big twitter following(keeping in mind this was 1970). He did have a limited amount of fame in certain gymnastics communities, a stellar reputation in several local communities, and pure determination. He leveraged all 3 to reach out to his end customer.

### Start even if you dont think version 1 of the product will be perfect:
That first week of camp many things were not completed. Systems were jury rigged to temporarily hold until better accommodations could be built.

#### Example: Disneyland:
When the first paying Disneyland patrons set foot in Disneyland many attractions were not finished and there was a massive shortage of toilets and other accommodations but that did not stop Walt Disney from launching the largest theme park franchise on the planet.

###Lesson Summary:
You don't need to follow all of the guidelines above, some rules are meant to be broken. Later I will tell you how the other founder, The Entripinuren's, complete lack of Technical knowledge on the topic of coaching gymnastics was a huge value to camp. The big takeaway from this section is *JUST START* you will thank yourself later in life.


## Lesson: Luck does play a role:
As much as we all would like to think that our skills or determination are what makes us successful I hate to have to admit that luck does play a roll. Don't get me wrong, nothing is accomplished without a whole lot of focused persistence in life, athletics, business or any endeavor worth pursuing, camp is no different. But luck is that variable that can ether knock you down or give you that extra little boost that makes everything go smoother.

No one had planned for the barn floor that magically gave an extra foot to any collegiate athlete that tumbles on it and how that would cause high level athletes to flock there to train. Nor did they take into account that the location of the camp central to so many east coast gymnastics clubs would be the perfect place to draw a high volume of customers. Both those two things were lucky breaks that lead to early success for camp.

Don't rely on luck, if you can minimize variables that cause risk then by all means do it. Just know that you cannot control everything, and keep your eyes open for the inevitable unexpected good and bad events that are just over the horizon. Capitalize on the good and do your best to mitigate the bad.

Example: Virgin Airlines:
When Sir Richard Branson was negotiating purchasing his first planes for Virgin Airlines he made a brilliant move. He negotiated a clause that stipulated he could return the planes after a set period of time if the airline was not successful. This way he would not be stuck with a bunch of costly assets if Virgin Airlines had failed taking the risk off of his plate. 

Take risks but whenever you can minimize the downside of those risks so you don't have to depend on luck,

## Lesson: Working on your business not in your business:
A lot of times I see business owners get stuck working in their business and fail to work on their business trapping themselfs. Remember our 3 roles from the E-Myth above. First all you nee is a Technician and an Entripinure and often times those are the same person.



### Applying it in the “Real World”:
This issue has constently plagued my career as well. Stepping away from being the lead engineer slinging code to run my business has been 


## Lesson: Iterate???
