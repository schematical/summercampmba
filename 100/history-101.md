## History 101 - Getting Started:
Our story follows two amazing brilliant indivduals. 

One of the lessions you will learn is to ask forgivness, not permission. Since I live by that and have not asked permission I will write this more as a fable then a completely biographical recap. That means the names and details have been changed to protect... me from getting sued. 

The original founder that started this whole thing in 1970 I will refer to as "The Technician". 

The secondary founder that arived on the scene and to this day acts as CEO I will refer to as "The Entripinure"

## Reading Assignment: E-Myth:
I did not pic the names of our two main charectors at random. I strongly suggest anyone going into business for them selfs become familar with [The E-Myth by Michael Gerber](TODO:LINK). It defines anyone involved with a business as one of the following arch types:

### Technician:
The technician is the person that does the technical work that results in the end product. For example in a resteraunt that would be the chef. In the case of running a gym this is the class teacher, or the team coach.

### Entripinure:
This is the person that has the bright(or terrable) idea to start a business. The one that sees a need and decides to fill it. The individual with the guts to sail uncharted teritories and the hutsva to make cold call after cold call until they get the first few sales. 

This could be the resteraunt owner that raises the capital then rents a venue and hires a staff. Its no different in the gym owners world.

### Manager:
The manager comes into play a little later in the picture. After you have a few steady customers and you need to hire more technicians to start building more of your product, cooking more meals, or teaching more beginner tumbling classes. 



You can be two out of 3 but typically one talent is more dominant then the others.

I describe the original founder as the technician not because he had no Entripinure trates, he had plenty of Entripinure trates. They are labeled this way because the secondary founder that came in around 1975 had a complete lack of Technician trates; which instantly gave him a huge advantage. 







## 1970:
Our story starts with the Technician a young man in his late 20s. A collegic athelete that love his sport, gymnastics. He had a vison(an Entripinure trate) of starting a summer camp that taught his favorite sport. He went around to various groups he was associated with and started to pitch his idea. Eventually he raised a little capital from members of his curch and found a nice affordable farm about 45 minutes drive from the college he competed at. 

He grabbed a hand full of friends, and aspiring atheletes and went to work converting this farm into a childrens summer camp. It took an entire summer and then some of work to build the cabins, setup a dinning hall, assmeble the training facility, and even shuvel out a large amount of cow maniure from under the barn that would serve as the training area. 

The Technician used his modest fame gained by being a popluar collegic athelete to market the camp to the local youth. Children who aspire to someday be a collegic athelete like he was. It worked, a handfull of aspiring male and female atheletes signed up for camp. He started to recive his first checks and was able to fund further development and staff costs for the camp.

Weeks before the camp was scheduled to have its first camper week they frantically worked to finish assembling what was left of camp. They just barely managed to make it livable with several temporary 'hacks' in place and they managed to launch. 

The first summer went off with, well many hitches. In the end they managed to push through and make a lot of amazing expirences for their campers and a lot of happy customers.  Lots of painful lessions were learned the hard way. 

Others were pleasent supprises, like when they found out that the wooden floor of the barn had more flexibility then your standard gymnasium floor. This means when you tumbled on it the floor acted as a stiff trampoliean giving the atheletes a good boost on each tumbling pass; a boost that allowed them to do bigger skills then they could at any other gym. The Technician had accidently invented an early version of the "spring floor" which is now standard at every gymnastics gym and competition in the world.






## Lesson: Just start
_"The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago. The second best time is now"_
### Start with what you know:
The Technican had spent a lot of his youth howning his skills as an athelete and a coach. He had a hude depth of knowladge on the field, and knew how to produce the results young atheletes and their parents(the ones with the check books) desired.

### Start with who you know:
- Raised money from his church
- Friends and team members from his amimater as staff

### Start with where you know:
- Started it 45 minutes from an area he knew really well so he could draw on all of the resources that he

### Start with what you have:
The Technician did NOT have a massive marketing budget or a big twitter following(keeping in mind this was 1970). He did have a limited amount of fame in certain gymnastics communities, a steller reputation in several local communities, and pure determination. He leveradged all 3 to reach out to his end customer.

### Start even if you dont think version 1 of the product will be perfect:
That first week of camp many things were not completed. Systems were juryrigged to temperarioly hold until better accomidations could be built.
Disneyland - When the first paying Disneyland patrons set foot in Disneyland there was a massive shortage of toilets because many just were not finished but that did not stop Walt Disney from launching the largest theme park franchise on the planet.

###Lession Summary:
You dont need to follow all of the guidlines above, some rules are ment to be broken. The big take away from this section is *JUST START* you will thank yourself later in life.


## Lesson: Luck does play a role:


Pure Luck: The Barn Floor

Radius/Circles

## Lesson: Iterate???
