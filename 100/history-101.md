#History - 101:
Our story follows two amazing brilliant indivduals. 

One of the lessions you will learn is to ask forgivness, not permission. Since I live by that and have not asked permission I will write this more as a fable then a completely biographical recap. That means the names and details have been changed to protect... me from getting sued. 

The original founder that started this whole thing in 1970 I will refer to as "The Technician". 

The secondary founder that arived on the scene and to this day acts as CEO I will refer to as "The Entripinure"

##Reading Assignment: E-Myth:
I did not pic the names of our two main charectors at random. I strongly suggest anyone going into business for them selfs become familar with [The E-Myth by Michael Gerber](TODO:LINK). It defines anyone involved with a business as one of the following arch types:

### Technician:
The technician is the person that does the technical work that results in the end product. For example in a resteraunt that would be the chef. In the case of running a gym this is the class teacher, or the team coach.

### Entripinure:
This is the person that has the bright(or terrable) idea to start a business. The one that sees a need and decides to fill it. The individual with the guts to sail uncharted teritories and the hutsva to make cold call after cold call until they get the first few sales. 

This could be the resteraunt owner that raises the capital then rents a venue and hires a staff. Its no different in the gym owners world.

### Manager:
The manager comes into play a little later in the picture. After you have a few steady customers and you need to hire more technicians to start building more of your product, cooking more meals, or teaching more beginner tumbling classes. 



You can be two out of 3 but typically one talent is more dominant then the others.

I describe the original founder as the technician not because he had no Entripinure trates, he had plenty of Entripinure trates. They are labeled this way because the secondary founder that came in around 1975 had a complete lack of Technician trates; which instantly gave him a huge advantage. 







## 1970:
Our story starts with the Technician a young man in his late 20s. A collegic athelete that love his sport, gymnastics. He had a vison(an Entripinure trate) of starting a summer camp that taught his favorite sport. He went around to various groups he was associated with and started to pitch his idea. Eventually he raised a little capital and found a nice affordable farm about 45 minutes drive from the college he competed at.
