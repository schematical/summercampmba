## Resource Aquisition 101:
The people that run camp have always been extreamly creative when it comes to resource aqusition. 
TODO: The Original Property







## Lessions:
### Be Creative:
The Entripinure had a knack for finding equipment neccisary to run camp cheaply and in quantities. The Entripinure found he could purchase used eqipment in bulk from the local university for pennies on the dollar. Most of what made up the kitchen appliences and utincles were purchased when one of the dorm cafeterias decided to upgrade their equipment and needed to make room for the new equipment.

The gym has a few non matted area inbetween the aperatices. Left exposed it is cold cement that is cold on young atheletes unshoed feet. They decided it would be best to cover the exposed cement with some type of flooring material. Instead of going out and purchasing some expensive flooring they took the old material used to cover the pratice field at the nearby university when the field was replaced.

####Applying it in the "Real World":
For my business this is difficult to describe how I have been creative with asset aqusition as my consulting business the majority of assets are human. Besides a handfull of laptops there are not much assets we need to do our job. I have relied heavily on pulling young talent from the University in my home town but I want to give you a better example.

So instead I will tell you about the coworking space I played a small part in starting and still am involved with called 100State. 100State started out as 8 people that rented out a stationairy railroad train car which the land loards had run electricity and pluming to. From there we grew to a larger space and expanded our membership. When this happened we needed more desks to accomidate our growing membership. Purchasing individual new desks would far exceed our budget. So we had to get creative. We had already been looking for sponsorship to offset the costs. Luckily one of our potential sponsors happened to be a large construction company that had a materials graveyard consisting of items that they ripped out of structures they were going to renivate. They did have some regular desks but due to our limited space we had at the time putting 1 desk for each member in the office would have exceeded our space constraints. So again we got creative and ditched the traditional desks then came up with another idea. We found that we could take an old door with the knob removed(which they had hundreds gathering dust and wanted to get rid of) and used it as a table surface supported by four waist high filing cabnits as lets worked just as well. Each one could fit around 8 members. As an added bonus we could easily run the power cords through the empty door knob hole. The soluiton was eligant and simple, we just had to get a little creative.





### Lession - Uniformity Looks Cool:
Another trick those that ran camp used to look more profesional while opperating on a tight budget was to use **Uniformaty** to their advantage. 

An example would be the vehicals used to transport children and staff to and from the bus stop and airports. Camp couldn't afford brand new vehicals so instead it use that to its advantage by buying a small fleet of used station wagons. We did the same with used golf carts used to transport campers and staff inside of camp. The uniform appearence, while unconventional, made the vehicals look intential, well thought out, and profesional(As profesional as a childrens summer camp needs to get).

Now days those station wagons have all far exceeded their lifespan and been retired. Now we have a small army of Zions, those little box cars that you look at and wondered "Who on eary would want to drive that?". The answer was not that many people so we scooped them up on the cheap.




####Applying it in the "Real World":
At 100State with the make shift desks we did the exact same thing. We took a disadvantage and turned it into an advantage. When you walked into our space instead of seeing variety of hodge podged desks of different types you saw 4 desks that though they looked unconventional all conformed to a uniform look and feel making it look more profeshional(slighlty). 

Side note: It also showed that we were doers. Not like those startups that took in big invester money then squandered it on resources that functioned more as a status symbol then anything functional. We were streamlined, spartain almost, and focused on what mattered over what stuff looked like.

### Embrace Grafiti (TODO: Better title - ?? Be Unique(Contrast Uniform)???)
???At camp we like to embrace our unique side as well. 

Moving as many children, parents, and staff through camp on the first day of each week of camp is complicated. There are 30 some different cabins now days spread out over several acers. Parents dropping of their children draging their campers laugague from the main parking lot across camp to the cabin their child will occupy for the next 6 nights having never set foot on camp soil before tend to get lost even with the printed map we give them at registration. They need signs to guid them. We could get professional signs and pay top dollar and put them up all over(And in some places we do have several). 


Instead most of our best eye catching signage at camp is grafaiti spray painted on the side of a cabin or large wooden signs built by the maintence team out of scraps wood.
We tap the creative talents of our young staff and empower them to make their mark on camp by giving them a can of spray paint and specific message that the reader of the sign will need to know and then let them go wild. Its not uncommen to see a cabin number or a specific land mark depicted by seeing a mural of some type of alian informing you that you are at cabin 13 B.

Unique eyecatching and notable. Most photographed




####Applying it in the "Real World":
At 100State we did something similar. 100State is not so big that it needs signage to get around. We had a lot of empty wall space that needed spicing up. Again we didnt have a big budget to buy fancy art and put it up. Instead we offered up our wall space to young aspiring artists. We gave them a free membership and allowed the artists to put their art on display and even put a price tag up if they were inclined to sell it. 

We empowered the younger aspiring artists to create a unique, memorabe expirence for our members and their guests. Everyone wins.
