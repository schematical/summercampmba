##Intro:
As I begin to write this opening paragraph I am staring out over a mountain range that surrounds {X} square miles of camp where, for this week, around one thousand children and staff are calling home. {25} cabins each containing up to {40} campers are slowly waking up, brushing their teeth(I hope) and strolling down to breakfast. They will eventually make their way to the morning session of their chosen programs. 

Behind me Junior Staff are starting to open one of the three gyms where hundreds of gymnasts, tumblers, cheerleaders, snow boarders, and parkour atheletes will be working out today.

In front of me I can see half a dozen skate parks and bike tracks that will be ridden by skate boarders, scooter kids, BMXers and moutain bikers.

{Tens of thousands} of dollars worth of frozen pizza, ice cream, frappechinos, slushies, cookies, and other various snack foods will be sold today. 

Social media will be flooded with {thousands} of photos of smiling campers chasing their dreams of being a high level gymnast or landing that big skate trick off of the mini-mega ramp(For those of you not famillar a giant ramp similar to the ones in the x-games).

And this is all just today. Imagine an entire week of this? Imagine an entire 12 weeks of this. Imagine the other various locations of this camp with several thousand more campers each week. 

Now imagine what it takes to run this place at this location alone:

* Feeding 3 square meals a day to just under a thousand staff and campers with big appatities because they just spent the previous day working out or instructing. 
* Housing all those people each week.
* Dealing with all of the waste roughly one thousand individuals create, both garbage as well as keeping the toilets flushing smoothly.
* Keeping one thousand people healthy. Both from injuries such a bumps and bruses incurred while training as well as from the sore tummies and asthma attacks.
* Staffing all of this, and dealing with constant turn over; training new staff each week to opperate this place.

Imagine what it takes to do all of this and more. Forty some years ago the founders of this place bought a small farm in the middle of no where moutain country and started off with just a dream. Since then they have managed to grow this place into one of the worlds most popular summer camps and sprout up international franchise locations all over the world.

##What is The Summer Camp MBA:
It is mind boggeling how much effort and persistance the founders of this camp must have put in to create this masterpeace. Some how over the past forty years they figured out how to do some pretty amazing things that we can learn from. Some of the lessons I personally have learned and will teach to you in this book are as follow:

* How camp sells a particular clothing item at  {25} times markup from the wholesale cost of the product. 
* How they actually have campers paying to come and produce comercials for camp. 
* How camp manages to run with an astounding {25-50%} staff turn over every week. 
* How they manage to cut costs and scale down to just a handful of people in the off-season.
* How to manage an everchanging staff of inexpirenced and expirenced, many of which have huge egos

These are just a few of lessons that I have been so fortunate to learn from my years of working at this increadible place that you will read about in this book.






##Who am I?
In 2004 I was a wide eyed 19 year old who had just home to Wisconsin returned from a catrastrophic summer semester at an art college in Ariazona. I had started assistant coaching at the local YMCA again which had been my passion since I started coaching at the age of 17. The atheletes in my charge were going to go to a sibbling branch of camp in my home state of Wisconsin and I was invited to be a "Visiting Coach" for the week. 

I had never been a competitive gymnast and had never been to any branches of camp. When I got there I imediatly fell in love with it. The next few summers I spent every week I could at the Wisconsin branch of camp. Eventually around the age of 22 I fell victim to the falicy that I needed to get a _"real job"_ and stopped going to camp all summer each summer. 


Luckily the _"real job"_ phase didn't last long for me. I proceeded to start and crash a series of small tech businesses each time falling back to coaching gymnastics as my rock and each time growing tougher and more expirenced. A few years after I stopped going the Wisconsin camp location was sold to a large private investor.


The summer of 2013 one of the directors at the original, non-wisconsin, camp location convinced me and one of my high level atheletes to come out for two weeks at the begining of summer. We did our two weeks and I imediatly fell in love with camp all over again. The two weeks flew by and we headed home. I had been working a tech contract for a startup in Milwaukee for the past 9 months and was about to show up for work the Monday after I got back when I got a phone call explaining that the startup had fallen on hard financial times(go figure) and had to lay off all of the contractors. 

So there I was with no job, no severance, no 2 weeks notice or anything. I didn't panic. I had been in far worse financial situations before. Instead having recently re-fallen in love with the camp life calmly called up the head gym director(who I will talk more about later) and asked if they needed staff for the rest of the summer. Luckily they said they would take me so I jumped on the bus camp charters to and from chicago to camp each week. Between then and the time that I am writing this book I have called camp my summer home and hope to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.


When I am not at camp I continue to run my businesses; the most successful to date being my tech consulting business but I am also expanding into real estate investments and publishing a few books(one which you are reading now).

###Why am I writing this book?
Having spent a lot of my 'real world' carreer working with early stage tech web startups I started to hear the same advice over and over again; A lot of Mark Zuckerburg wannabees out there repeating whatever the advice of the month is. For example when Eric Rise's book The Lean Startup came out all of the suddon when lazy tech startup founders got board or mildly inconvinenced by an obstical to overcome they would 'piviot', then pivot again and again until they had wasted all of their founders money. Don't get me wrong, it was a great book, but my point is that the tech startup world is like a cult. There are a few hardcore business leaders out there doing their own thing but then the vast majority of flash in the pan guys trying to emulate whatever Groupon-esc company is hot that day. The latter blindly repeating whatever advise they read in the latest TechCrunch interview.

It pains me to admin it but in my early 20s I was one of those guys. Since then I have stopped drinking the cool-aid(as much). I decided to take the low and slow approch to my business and life. Instead of building businesses that balloon up to one million users with absolutly no revinue model then fizzle out as they try to monitize I have decided to focus on small businesses that generate revinue from day 1. Call me old fashion but I figure my businesses should make money. 

Since most of the big unicorn tech startups out there didn't worry about revinue until well their series A I decided to widen my search outside of the tech industury. I have studied the business models of:

* Childrens Summer Camps(Obviously)
* Restraunts
* Hotels
* Dry cleaners
* Financial consultants
* Comidities exchange markets
* Dance coriogripfers
* Bloggers
* Vloggers(Video Bloggers)
* Book publishers
* Film industury producers
* Professional atheletes
* Crossfit gyms
* Tough Mudder
* Cheer gyms
* Amazon drop ship businesses
* Noveltly pet poop bags

And many more. There is a suprising amount of applicable information that you can learn and apply to a tech business from studying these more traditional(and some less traditional like the dog poop bags) businesses. 

Most tech business models have only been around for a decaid or less. Many of these other models have been around for 50-100 years; some even longer. They have been time tested. Though many resteraunts are contantly trying to find ways to innovate and change the industury the fundementals of echanging money for a cooked meal have been around for thousands of years. 

I have had the priviladge of looking behind the scenes at one of these more traditional businesses, Camp, and observing first hand this beautiful machine in action. I have studied its various unique revinue streams. 

Now it is time to put it all down into writing.

One of my favorite authors, Tim Ferriss, gave me the idea for this book with his post called [How to Create Your Own Real-World MBA](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2010/06/28/mba/). The post sums up an expirement he did: Instead of dropping the massive cost of going to school to get his MBA, which would have gotten him mainly theoretical book knowladge, he took a sum of money equal to the cost of getting his MBA and started investing it in real projects. He wrote off the money he alocated as if it was already lost, same as if he had spent it on the traditioanl MBA. This way he would not be afraid to risk it as, in his mind, it was already spent. After two years of investing in real world projects he learned a lot of harsh non-theoretical lessons and had accumulated real expirence that he could apply to his investing carreer moving forward.

Tim may have gotten his "Real-World MBA" but I am proud to say I have recived my "Summer Camp MBA". No I didn't drop any money on it (lets just say I was on scollarship) but I put in my time working in and on this amazing business for now I will simply call "Camp". 


##//What is this book?
This book is a summary of the lessons I have learned by observing the inner workings of camp. The percision engineered interactions between campers and staff as well as the interactions that happen more organically. Lessons learned from many short and some long conversations with the original founders of camp and their top level directors. Lessions that the founders.

Lessions many of which I sincerly belive can apply to your business no matter what industury you business is in.







##Why do I not use the camps name?

- I did not ask permission to write this book -  Instead I will ask forgivness if need be

In just my short time here this remote paradice, which started out as a barn and an old house, has been patrionized by multiple parties from all over the world:
* Geremany
* Cananda
* Denmark
* Latvia
* Ukrain
* Russia
* Mexico

And dozzens more I am sure.

Some of the most famous gold medalist olympians and professional x-games atheletes to have ever walked the face of this earth have traveld great distances to attend camp; many even to train here.

This amazing, beautiful, complex, machine I call camp is a living breathing masterpiece. No, I don't mean to say it is perfect by any means, but it is truely amazing what a hand full of people lead by two brilliant visionaries have built in the middle of nowhere; In a vally surrounded by farms, {10} miles from the nearest traffic light.

This place is a great many things to a great many people. To some campers it is skate board heavin. Parkour atheletes may see it as the holy land of parkour. A lot of the gymnasts I coach see it as their favorite week of the year. To some of the yonger staff its a great way to train and earn a hundred or so dollars a week(A hell of a lot better then flipping burgers). Other more serious carreer coaches see it as a way to learn from other more established coaches. To pretty much everyone, staff and camper, it is an amazing life changing expirence.

To me it is all that and more. Though I love all of the simple enjoyments here:

* Playing "Mat Tag" for warmup.
* Enjoying a free ice cream while watching some kids butcher a song during Kariokie
* Enjoying the company of my many friends that I have made from many various backgrounds
* Hob nobbing with any one of the many olympic gold metalists that that attend camp
* The excitment in the eyes of an athelete after I help them achive a big skill
* Sneeking in a hand balencing workout inbetween coaching sessions

But as serial entripinure I can appriciate this amazing place for the side that most of the campers are completely unaware of. Camp is also a business. The reality is in order to create all of those expirences, serve all of those meals, maintain all of those skate ramps and trampolines we need staff, materials, and facilities that all cost money. To make the money to do all of these things camp has to be a business. It must have employees, do marketing, provide a service, and in the end turn a profit at the end of the summer.

Does this mean that camp and those who run it are only in it for the money? No! Nothing could be further from the truth. Those that run this place run it with their heart at great personal costs. But they do respect the fact that it takes a significant amount of capital to maintain this amazing place. They face the hard realities of business so that the campers can live out their greatest fantcies during their stay here. These less tangible lessons are equally, if not more important, as the lessions on how to turn a profit and the I will get them more in the chapters found in the later half of this book.
