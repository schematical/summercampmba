##Intro:
As I begin to write this opening paragraph I am staring out over a mountain range that surrounds {X} square miles of camp where, for this week, around one thousand children and staff are calling home. {25} cabins each containing up to {40} campers are slowly waking up, brushing their teeth(I hope) and strolling down to breakfast. They will eventually make their way to the morning session of their chosen programs. 

Behind me Junior Staff are starting to open one of the three gyms where hundreds of gymnasts, tumblers, cheerleaders, snow boarders, and parkour atheletes will be working out today.

In front of me I can see half a dozen skate parks and bike tracks that will be ridden by skate boarders, scooter kids, BMXers and moutain bikers.

{Tens of thousands} of dollars worth of frozen pizza, ice cream, frappechinos, slushies, cookies, and other various snack foods will be sold today. 

Social media will be flooded with {thousands} of photos of smiling campers chasing their dreams of being a high level gymnast or landing that big skate trick off of the mini-mega ramp(For those of you not famillar a giant ramp similar to the ones in the x-games).

And this is all just today. Imagine an entire week of this? Imagine an entire 12 weeks of this. Imagine the other various locations of this camp with several thousand more campers. 

Now imagine what it takes to run this place. Just at this location alone feeding 3 square meals a day to about a thousand staff and campers with big appatities because they just spent the previous day working out or instructing. 

Imagine the monumential task of housing all those people. Who stays with whome.
Imagine the amount of maintaince that goes into keeping this place running, clogged toilets, power outages, etc.
Imagine keeping one thousand people healthy. Both from injuries such a bumps and bruses incurred while training as well as from the sore tummies and asthma attacks that happen outside of the gym.
Imagine staffing all of this, and dealing with constant turn over; training new staff each week to opperate this place.






This amazing, beautiful, complex, machine I call camp is a living breathing masterpiece. No, I don't mean to say it is perfect by any means, but it is truely amazing what a hand full of people lead by two brilliant visionaries have built in the middle of nowhere; In a vally surrounded by farms, {10} miles from the nearest traffic light.

This place is a great many things to a great many people. To some campers it is skate board heavin. Parkour atheletes may see it as the holy land of parkour. A lot of the gymnasts I coach see it as their favorite week of the year. To some of the yonger staff its a great way to train and earn a hundred or so dollars a week(A hell of a lot better then flipping burgers). Other more serious carreer coaches see it as a way to learn from other more established coaches. To pretty much everyone, staff and camper, it is an amazing life changing expirence.

To me it is all that and more. Though I love all of the simple enjoyments here:

* Playing "Mat Tag" for warmup.
* Enjoying a free ice cream while watching some kids butcher a song during Kariokie
* Enjoying the company of my many friends that I have made from many various backgrounds
* Hob nobbing with any one of the many olympic gold metalists that that attend camp
* The excitment in the eyes of an athelete after I help them achive a big skill
* Sneeking in a hand balencing workout inbetween coaching sessions

But as serial entripinure I can appriciate this amazing place for the side that most of the campers are completely unaware of. Camp is also a business. The reality is in order to create all of those expirences, serve all of those meals, maintain all of those skate ramps and trampolines we need staff, materials, and facilities that all cost money. To make the money to do all of these things camp has to be a business. It must have employees, do marketing, provide a service, and in the end turn a profit at the end of the summer.

Does this mean that camp and those who run it are only in it for the money? No! Nothing could be further from the truth. Those that run this place run it with their heart at great personal costs. But they do respect the fact that it takes a significant amount of capital to maintain this amazing place. They face the hard realities of business so that the campers can live out their greatest fantcies during their stay here. These less tangible lessons are equally, if not more important, as the lessions on how to turn a profit and the I will get them more in the chapters found in the later half of this book. 



##Who am I?
In 2004 I was a wide eyed 19 year old who had just home to Wisconsin returned from a catrastrophic summer semester at an art college in Ariazona. I had started assistant coaching at the local YMCA again which had been my passion since I started coaching at the age of 17. The atheletes in my charge were going to go to a sibbling branch of camp in my home state of Wisconsin and I was invited to be a "Visiting Coach" for the week. 

I had never been a competitive gymnast and had never been to any branches of camp. When I got there I imediatly fell in love with it. The next few summers I spent every week I could at the Wisconsin branch of camp. Eventually around the age of 22 I fell victim to the falicy that I needed to get a _"real job"_ and stopped going to camp all summer each summer. 


Luckily the _"real job"_ phase didn't last long for me. I proceeded to start and crash a series of small tech businesses each time falling back to coaching gymnastics as my rock and each time growing tougher and more expirenced. A few years after I stopped going the Wisconsin camp location was sold to a large private investor.


The summer of 2013 one of the directors at the original, non-wisconsin, camp location convinced me and one of my high level atheletes to come out for two weeks at the begining of summer. We did our two weeks and I imediatly fell in love with camp all over again. The two weeks flew by and we headed home. I had been working a tech contract for a startup in Milwaukee for the past 9 months and was about to show up for work the Monday after I got back when I got a phone call explaining that the startup had fallen on hard financial times(go figure) and had to lay off all of the contractors. 

So there I was with no job, no severance, no 2 weeks notice or anything. I didn't panic. I had been in far worse financial situations before. Instead having recently re-fallen in love with the camp life calmly called up the head gym director(who I will talk more about later) and asked if they needed staff for the rest of the summer. Luckily they said they did and I jumped on the bus camp charters from chicago to camp each
