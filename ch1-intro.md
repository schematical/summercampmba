##Intro:
As I begin to write this opening paragraph I am staring out over a mountain range that surrounds {X} square miles of camp where, for this week, around one thousand children and staff are calling home. {25} cabins each containing up to {40} campers are slowly waking up, brushing their teeth(I hope) and strolling down to breakfast. They will eventually make their way to the morning session of their chosen programs. 

Behind me Junior Staff are starting to open one of the three gyms where hundreds of gymnasts, tumblers, cheerleaders, snow boarders, and parkour atheletes will be working out today.

In front of me I can see half a dozen skate parks and bike tracks that will be ridden by skate boarders, scooter kids, BMXers and moutain bikers.

{Tens of thousands} of dollars worth of frozen pizza, ice cream, frappechinos, slushies, cookies, and other various snack foods will be sold today. 

Social media will be flooded with {thousands} of photos of smiling campers chasing their dreams of being a high level gymnast or landing that big skate trick off of the mini-mega ramp(For those of you not famillar a giant ramp similar to the ones in the x-games).

And this is all just today. Imagine an entire week of this? Imagine an entire 12 weeks of this. Imagine the other various locations of this camp with several thousand more campers. 

Now imagine what it takes to run this place. Just at this location alone feeding 3 square meals a day to about a thousand staff and campers with big appatities because they just spent the previous day working out or instructing. 

Imagine the monumential task of housing all those people. Who stays with whome.
Imagine the amount of maintaince that goes into keeping this place running, clogged toilets, power outages, etc.
Imagine keeping one thousand people healthy. Both from injuries such a bumps and bruses incurred while training as well as from the sore tummies and asthma attacks that happen outside of the gym.
Imagine staffing all of this, and dealing with constant turn over; training new staff each week to opperate this place.

This amazing, beautiful, complex, machine I call camp is a living breathing masterpiece. No, I don't mean to say it is perfect by any means, but it is truely amazing what a hand full of people lead by two brilliant visionaries have built in the middle of nowhere; In a vally surrounded by farms, {10} miles from the nearest traffic light.

In just my short time here this remote paradice, which started out as a barn and an old house, has been patrionized by multiple parties from all over the world:
* Geremany
* Cananda
* Denmark
* Latvia
* Ukrain
* Russia
* Mexico
*

And dozzens more I am sure.

Some of the most famous gold medalist olympians and professional x-games atheletes to have ever walked the face of this earth have traveld great distances to attend camp; many even to train here.
