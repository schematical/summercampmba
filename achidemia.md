##MBA:
Often times there are many paths to the same destination. Not everyone is cut out for achidemia; I sure was not. Some people learn best by getting their hands dirty. Theoretical concepts don't sink in as much as the sting of learning a hands on lession the hard way. Perhaps I was impatiant when I dropped out of school to start my first tech startup instead of ridding out my undergrad then enrolling in another two or more years of school for my Acidemia MBA. Perhaps I would not have ran my first startup into the ground. But would I have even started my first tech startup if I was not impatient? If I was afraid of learning lessions the hard way and failing a couple times before success?

###Disclaimer:
What I am about to say is not meant to detract from the many great business schools out there. I have been fortunite to have been invited to speak to classes at the University of Wisconsin's businesss school and have enjoyed it very much. But as I said it is just not for everyone. 

###Real World MBAs:
So what do you do if you are not suited for Achidemia but you still want to take your learning on business to a higher level? You could do what one of my favorite authors, Tim Ferriss, did in his post [How to Create Your Own Real-World MBA](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2010/06/28/mba/). The post sums up an expirement he did: Instead of dropping the massive cost of going to school to get his MBA, which would have gotten him mainly theoretical book knowladge, he took a sum of money equal to the cost of getting his MBA and started investing it in real projects. He wrote off the money he alocated as if it was already lost, same as if he had spent it on the traditioanl MBA. This way he would not be afraid to risk it as, in his mind, it was already spent. After two years of investing in real world projects he learned a lot of harsh non-theoretical lessons and had accumulated real expirence that he could apply to his investing carreer moving forward.

###Enter the Summer Camp MBA:
I am not so pompus as to think that I could wallow away my summers in the utopia that is Camp for a decaide and walk away with the same piece of paper Acidemic MBA studients get. My "Summer Camp MBA" is completely different then an "Achidemic MBA". While Acidemic MBA students were reading books on accounting pratices I was making sure the line for registration wasnt to long. While they were listening to a lecture on economics I was watching one of the founders of camp tear down the welcome day setup and rebuild it the way he belive would be most effective.

I passed no written tests to get my Summer Camp MBA. I never recived a report card. My grades were recived in the form of paychecks, coach of the week awards, and thank you letters from the children. My office hours were held with camp directors by the burger grill sitting on an unused snowboarding ramp.


I never did any of those things that Acidemic MBA's do. In reality the only thing I did do(which is actually more similar to a doctorial canidate) is write, for lack of a better term, my 'thesis' which you are reading now.


What did I do that makes my Summer Camp MBA valuable in the business world?


I observed those that had spent over 4 decaids of their life running this massive amazing odd business.
I helped run aspects of that business to get hands on expirence. 
I worked with actuall customers, saw actual dollars exchanging hands.
I made mistakes that had real consiquences that stung. When I fell down I picked myself up and did better the second time through.
I took the lessions I learned and applied them to my real world businesses.
I didn't just read books on the topic, instead I wrote one.

This book is my Magnum opus. An informal final paper to share what I have learned over the years on business with the world.
