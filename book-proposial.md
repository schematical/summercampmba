## Overview:
In my adult life I have spent the majority of my summers working at one of the worlds most popular summercamps. Over the years I studied how the founders started and grew this amazing business. 
I learned some amazing lessions:
- How to get the people doing your marketing to pay you to do your marketing for you.
- How to get more then a 20x mark up selling a physical good(Not herion)
- How to sustain your business when you have 25% staff turn over each week

Using these lessions and many more I learned at camp I built my own small business which grossed over half a milliond dollars last year and I did it without ever taking a traditional business class nor having a college degree. I will share these the lessions I learned from the brillant people that run camp in Summer Camp MBA.


## Audience:
I am writing the book with a few of my atheletes in mind(I am a gymnastics coach) that are looking to start their own business but have no traditional background on the topic and are struggling where to start as well as a few atheletes that are dialusioned with the options given to them by the traditional institutinal higher education system due to education inflation and are in need of another path that by passes the educational glass celing and doesn't require them to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on theroetical eductation.

//TODO ^ @editor ^ this is a massive run on sentance - please figure out a better way to phrase it.

Though I am writing this book with these few atheletes in mind the world is filled with similiarly minded individuals that will find Summer Camp MBA a valuable resource to help them change their life.

### Podcast Circut and Guest Writing:

### Potential endorsers
I plan to reach out to some super connectors that have done work in similar areas to see if they are interested in offering a quote or otherwise endoursing Summer Camp MBA.

#### Seth Goden:
Seth Goden created a program called Alt MBA ( altmba.com ) as an alternitive to traditional MBAs. Since my book has a reoccuring theme about non-traditional/non-institutional learning methods there is overlap that could benifit both Summer Camp MBA and Alt MBA.

#### Michael Eisner:
Wrote the book "Camp" about the life lessions he learned as a child at summer camp. Hopfully as a massivly successful business person he will find the similarities enough to endourse the book.
