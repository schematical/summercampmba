## Chapter outlines
This is a very sparse outline, breaking down each chapter, by name and number, into a one or two-sentence description, followed by bulleted chapter contents and/or very short description.

## Bonus content
This can be fun bonus adds to the book, such as activities or interactive/online content having to do with the book.

## Marketing plan
The sky’s the limit!

This section lists what the author and publisher might do in considering the marketing and publicity behind the book’s publication.

## Sample chapters
Three-five fully-written and polished sample chapters from the forthcoming manuscript will need to be included with the book proposal.

On the higher end, nonfiction book proposals can top out around 50-75 pages, not including sample chapters.

It’s also worth noting that in nonfiction, it is not enough to have a good idea to write about, for it to be well-written and for the author to be an authority on the subject matter — author platform is what is key to nonfiction.
