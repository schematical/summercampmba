## Audience
Concisely in a paragraph or two, interested demographic(s) of the book are listed here.

Providing a testament of the public’s powerful desire and current trends behind that can also be listed on this section’s page.

Purpose and need
On a much deeper level, this section tells us why we as readers need to read this book, and why now? In a simple way, the reader has a problem or a yearning, and this book fulfills that need with its purpose.

It’s OK to take a page or so to explain.

## Unique angles
How the book can carve its place out in a busy marketplace of similar books can be expounded here. Some of the takeaways that can only be experienced from this very book should be shared here, perhaps in bulleted format.

## Reader benefits
What will the reader gain from reading this book? This section answers that question with a number of benefits to the reader.

Will the reader experience joy? Will they feel a part of something bigger than themselves? Tell us here in this section along a short list.

## Potential endorsers
This is a section devoted to a list of people of note who could provide advance praise/blurbs for the forthcoming book.

They might even be people of note who would be willing to write an introduction or forward to the book. Not only names should be listed here, but titles and why these are important endorsements.

For example: Amy Poehler, founder of UCB, Parks and Recreation, SNL

## Book structure overview
Here is where you list the format, eventual word count (preferably within normal or appropriate range), page count, deadline by which a finished manuscript could be turned into the publisher, following a signed contract.

About the author(s)
Can you guess what you do here? Write a little something about yourself!

It can be as simple as one paragraph or a couple of pages. Relevant writing experience, credentials, awards/accolades, previous publications, fun facts, links to author sites and social media pages (as well as the number of social media followers, if impressive), fun personal facts, and contact info can be listed here.

Sales history of previous books
For authors with previously published books, this is a list of titles, along with publisher name and publication date.

Below that should be the total sales numbers on the book, from publication-to-date.

If a book from this list was translated into other languages, had a film/TV adaptation, or was turned into an audiobook, that can be mentioned here, too.

## Chapter outlines
This is a very sparse outline, breaking down each chapter, by name and number, into a one or two-sentence description, followed by bulleted chapter contents and/or very short description.

## Bonus content
This can be fun bonus adds to the book, such as activities or interactive/online content having to do with the book.

## Marketing plan
The sky’s the limit!

This section lists what the author and publisher might do in considering the marketing and publicity behind the book’s publication.

## Sample chapters
Three-five fully-written and polished sample chapters from the forthcoming manuscript will need to be included with the book proposal.

On the higher end, nonfiction book proposals can top out around 50-75 pages, not including sample chapters.

It’s also worth noting that in nonfiction, it is not enough to have a good idea to write about, for it to be well-written and for the author to be an authority on the subject matter — author platform is what is key to nonfiction.
