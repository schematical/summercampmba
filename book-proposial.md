## Overview:
In my adult life I have spent the majority of my summers working at one of the world's most popular summer camps. Over the years I studied how the founders started and grew this amazing business. 
I learned some amazing lessons:
- How to get the people doing your marketing to pay you to do your marketing for you.
- How to get more than a 20x markup selling a physical good(Not heroin)
- How to sustain your business when you have 25% staff turn over each week

Using these lesions and many more I learned at camp I built my own small business which grossed over half a million dollars last year and I did it without ever taking a traditional business class nor having a college degree. I will share these the lessons I learned from the brilliant people that run camp in Summer Camp MBA.


//TODO - "Real world" vs "Summer Camp Parody"

## Audience:
I am writing the book with a few of my athletes in mind(I am a gymnastics coach) that are looking to start their own business but have no traditional background on the topic and are struggling where to start as well as a few athletes that are disillusioned with the options given to them by the traditional institutional higher education system due to education inflation and are in need of another path that by passes the educational glass celing and doesn't require them to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on theoretical education.

//TODO ^ @editor ^ this is a massive run on sentence - please figure out a better way to phrase it.

Though I am writing this book with these few athletes in mind the world is filled with similarly minded individuals that will find Summer Camp MBA a valuable resource to help them change their life.

## Chapter outlines:

### Format:
- Lecture - The anecdotal body of the chapter
- Lessons - Specific lessons to be pulled from the chapter
- Applying it in the "Real World" - Applying the information outside of a camp setting. This could be my business or the coworking space I helped found or my athletes businesses.
- Reading Assignments - Books related to the info in the topic that will add value to the reader.



## Marketing plan:

### Podcast Circuit and Guest Writing:

//TODO: @andy/VA - We need to populate a list of potential podcasts to go on - Focus on small business/lifestyle design
- Duct Tape Marketing - https://www.ducttapemarketing.com/about/duct-tape-marketing-podcast/

### Potential endorsers
I plan to reach out to some super connectors that have done work in similar areas to see if they are interested in offering a quote or otherwise endorsing Summer Camp MBA.

#### Seth Godin:
Seth Godin created a program called Alt MBA ( altmba.com ) as an alternative to traditional MBAs. Since my book has a recurring theme about non-traditional/non-institutional learning methods there is overlap that could benefit both Summer Camp MBA and Alt MBA.

#### Michael Eisner:
Wrote the book "Camp" about the life lessons he learned as a child at summer camp. Hopefully as a massively successful business person he will find the similarities enough to endorse the book.
 
#### The Founders of Camp:
