## Sample chapters
_Three-five fully-written and polished sample chapters from the forthcoming manuscript will need to be included with the book proposal.

On the higher end, nonfiction book proposals can top out around 50-75 pages, not including sample chapters.

It’s also worth noting that in nonfiction, it is not enough to have a good idea to write about, for it to be well-written and for the author to be an authority on the subject matter — author platform is what is key to nonfiction._
